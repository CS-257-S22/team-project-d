0_bj,2017-04-15,3,Not enough brownies!,"Super good, don't get me wrong. But I came for the caramel and brownies, not the sweet cream. The packaging made it seem like brownies were packed and bountiful *crying frowny emoji* I'd say the taste of this was amazing, but the ratio of brownie to sweet cream was disappointing. Liked it regardless but probably won't buy again simply because it didn't live up to its promising package. I'll find another one that has a better ratio and wayyy more yummy chewy brownies.
Overall, good flavor, texture, idea, and brownies. Not so great caramel/sweet cream/ brownie RATIO. Just add more brownies. Please."
0_bj,2020-01-05,5,I’m OBSESSED with this pint!,"I decided to try it out although I’m not a huge caramel fan, and the first buy was ok, didn’t like the caramel too much and for some reason that specific pint barely had any brownies! Like there were some on top but from the middle to the bottom? Zilch. Nada. Nothing! It was disappointing. But for some reason, I bought it again and I really do believe it was just that point bcuz the second one was glorious!! I had a big brownie chunk in EVERY bite. Plus the caramel didn’t bother me as much and I took a liking to it. Conclusion: I’m on my fifth pint, of the week and I’m going back to get my daily pint cus I’m kinda sick and need some happiness."
0_bj,2018-04-26,3,My favorite...More Caramel Please,"My caramel core begins to disappear about half way through. I only buy this for the caramel core. The first time I purchased this I was not even aware that there were blonde bits in there. You had me a salted caramel core, well this is the fourth pint that I have purchased and the caramel is plentiful at the top then it begins to get sparse about half way down at 3/4s of the way down its gone. It works out in my husbands favor because he doesn't care for the caramel so he gets to finish my pint while having a full pint of his choice. Please please please, its called salted caramel core for a reason. Let the caramel flow through the core. P.S. You could put a little extra in there, I totally would not mind."
0_bj,2018-01-14,5,Obsessed!!!,"Why are people complaining about the blonde brownies? If you don’t like blonde brownies, get ice cream with fudge brownies! I LOVE the blonde brownies and cannot get enough of them. This ice cream is by far my favorite. I have driven to multiple stores to try and find it... and when I do, I stock up! I’ve tried other flavors when I can’t find this one, and none of them even come close to making me as happy as this does! I’d say sometimes the caramel to brownie ratio is a little off at times (more brownies please!), but I’ll still always enjoy it nevertheless!"
0_bj,2020-07-24,1,Worst Ice Cream Ever!,"This ice cream is worst ice cream I’ve ever tasted. I was beyond excited when I picked it up today and couldn’t wait to get home and try it. First the sweet cream ice cream has no flavour. But that’s fine I could get past that, but the salted caramel core is what’s really wrong. It’s disgusting and so salty it’s actually inedible. I’ve had ice cream before that I have really enjoyed but never to the point where I physically can not stomach it. I love salted caramel but this is just another level. I actually came here to read the reviews and see how others thought of it just in case mine was a bad batch. Never again!"
0_bj,2020-07-23,2,Way Too Salty,"I bought this last night to go with Louisiana Crunch cake because I was craving that salty and sweet flavor. Unfortunately, I was not thrilled with the salted caramel core of this ice cream. Usually, when you have salted caramel, the salt enhances the flavor of the caramel. The salt in this core OVERWHELMED everything, even the cake. It was disappointing to not enjoy my dessert and I doubt I'll be finishing this pint of ice cream, which is a shame because you should never have to throw away ice cream."
0_bj,2017-05-28,3,"Love this flavor, but...","This is definitely my favorite flavor, but recently, it does not have enough blonde brownie chunks. I'll go through at least half of the pint with just 1 or 2 chunks. It looks like plain ice cream with a salted caramel core. This has happened a lot lately, and it's so dissapointing. I've gotten to the point where I simply stopped buying it. Today, purchased two because they were on sale. It started the way it should be, with plenty of yummy chunks. Before I even got halfway as I was serving myself, no more chunks. After some digging around, I found 3 more way at the bottom. Please fix this! I love this ice cream, but it's pointless without the chunks."
0_bj,2017-07-02,3,Really Wanted To Love This,"I am not a chocolate person at all, and this was my very first time trying Ben & Jerry's, (Shame on me I'm 23 lol) so I was so excited to find a Caramel Ice Cream with BLONDE Brownie chunks instead of fudge. I really wanted to like this ice cream but I just couldn't. The Salted Caramel is a little too salty, In fact, I couldn't even eat the core, I just ate around it. I didn't really like the Sweet Cream Ice Cream, it didn't really have a taste to me, (Maybe Vanilla would be better). The only thing I loved about this Ice Cream were the Blonde Brownie Chunks, They were so delicious! I would love for this Ice Cream Recipe to be worked on, maybe I'll give it a try again in the future."
0_bj,2017-07-16,2,Could be better.,"I LOVE caramel, so much so that I could eat it off a spoon, which was exactly what I was planning to do when I bought this ice cream. Unfortunately this caramel core is way too salty. I actually eat around it! I'm not a fan of the sweet cream ice cream flavor either; vanilla would've worked better. The blondie pieces were delicious but overall I'm disappointed. I really wanted to love this since I love Ben & Jerry's but this was not up to par with their other flavors!"
0_bj,2019-02-12,3,Salted Caramel core had NO CARAMEL,I love all the Ben & Jerry’s flavor. But recently I been so disappointed of my favorite flavor salted core caramel. It has no core
0_bj,2019-06-02,2,Caramel ended 1/2 way through,The ice cream really didn’t taste like anything significant and then the caramel which carried the whole dessert ended half way through the cup :( very disappointed!
0_bj,2019-08-23,1,Core went about an inch into the pint,The core was absolutely delicious for about a scoop of icecream. Then there was no core for the entire rest of the pint. Huge disappointment.
0_bj,2018-02-15,3,good on top...not so good the further down you get,"I've seen this flavor multiple times at the grocery store the past few months and been tempted, finally pulled the trigger last week."
0_bj,2018-05-06,1,Oh dear,"I feel like a dork writing a review for ice cream, but usually a pint only lasts us 3-5 days in our home and we were so disappointed with this one and it's still in the freezer a month later untouched. In addition, I love anything caramel but the salted caramel core was so overbearing, I honestly don't know how this made it on to be a final flavor after the taste testers tried it. It's just too salty. We scooped the caramel into the sink, but then the rest was just a little boring. I will still be a loyal B&J fan, but will be super hesitant when it comes to their caramel line."
0_bj,2019-09-03,3,Why aren’t the brownie bits chewy?,Hello. I just bought my 4th and 5th pints of salted caramel core while awaiting Hurricane Dorian to arrive. I will have to say that my son and I greatly enjoyed the first 3. Plenty of salty caramel (yum) and plenty of brownie bits that were chewy to the bite. However these last 2 pints that I just purchased do have plenty of caramel and brownie bits but they aren’t chewy. They are more crumbly to the bite. I’m not sure if the first 3 were a fluke or these last 2 weren’t right. Is the brownie supposed to be chewy or crumbly? These last 2 were disappointing for us and makes me question whether we should buy this kind again.
0_bj,2020-06-24,5,No Regrets!,"So it's the middle of June and I made an impromptu decision to get a small thing of ice cream during my shopping trip. I initially was thinking of going for a strawberry or peach flavor, but then I saw this pint and had a double take. I'd never try this flavor prior and man, I do not regret it. I love this pint. I love sweet cream and blonde brownie so this was a win-win. I like how to salted caramel is in the center so I have the ability to control how much I want in each bite. I do agree that the salted caramel is a bit on the salty side, but like I said, I have the control to put as little as I want in my scoop."
0_bj,2018-03-15,5,Perfection!,"I'll be completely honest, I'm not generally a fan of caramel (it's just too sweet for me) but I gave this flavor a shot because of the sweet cream ice cream. As it turns out, the saltiness of the caramel core perfectly balances out the sweetness! I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the salted caramel core. The blonde brownie chunks were also a nice touch and not too overwhelming. I feel like the ratio of mix ins to chunks was nicely balanced."
0_bj,2020-03-07,5,Wow just wow,Okay I was expecting an almost too salty weirdly over sweet ice cream but man was I wrong!!! No seriously!!! I started eating this ice cream and was transported to the first time I had gooey caramel pop corn... the ice cream was like eating sweet corn creamy and smooth and the chewy bits supposed to be brownie tasted like caramel pop corn that had gotten chewy and sweet soaked in ice cream.. then the salty caramel center was too good to even say but together the best caramel pop corn ice cream I have ever had.. even though I don’t know if that’s what they were going for lol.. my favorite flavor so far
0_bj,2018-06-29,4,"So good, but...","This was my 1st pint of Salted Caramel Core but not my first Ben and Jerry’s Core pint. My first impression was that my core was HUGE! It was literally overflowing when I opened the pint! Wow! And the caramel itself was delicious; salty sweet and gooey! The sweet cream ice cream was very rich and cut through the sweet of the core nicely. My only issue was the blonde brownie bits. It’s not that they weren’t plentiful, I just really didn’t like the taste of them, which is sad because the rest of the pint was KILLER! The chocolate brownies in the other flavors are amazingly good so I was disappointed that these blonde ones weren’t very good and I ate around them. So, all in all, it was a good pint with amazing caramel, good ice cream and funky brownies."
0_bj,2020-04-01,5,Favorite Flavor!,"This is my all time favorite flavor. For me it's the perfect combination of sweet and salty and its upsetting to see so many people hate on it. I think vanilla would be too over powering but everyone's taste buds are different. I do agree the blonde brownie bits have been lacking... but I'm an eat the entire pint kinda gal.. oops..sit down to a good movie and this is my go to snack to grab (wish it came in a dairy free option, but I live in WI so I suffer through being lactose intolerant all the time)
So in short, it is sweet and salty flavor. I always have a partial scoop of ice cream to core spoonful I eat and I guess I'm the weirdo that runs outta caramel before ice cream... oops xD"
0_bj,2019-03-03,2,Too much,I love carmel so much and as soon as I saw carmel core I grabbed it off the shelf. The carmel tastes great and I love the ice cream and blonde brownie pieces in it!!! The only thing that is wrong with it is how much carmel they gave me. It was 3/4 carmel and 1/4 ice cream. It wasn’t a good balance and I probably won’t get it again.
0_bj,2019-04-14,5,My Favorite Flavor- One of a Kind,"I always wanted a flavor of ice cream that was tailored to the way my taste buds worked. Most ice cream flavors from other companies that have cookie dough in it is chocolate based, but Ben & Jerry’s has cornered the market: this cookie dough is caramel and butter and cookie based (or blondie if that’s the correct term)! I’ve been buying it almost every weekend at college for a year! Please keep this flavor, it makes me so happy. The fact that there’s a cookie dough flavor that is chocolate free is one of a kind and not many ice companies make that!"
0_bj,2020-04-19,1,Core more like pencil line,I was so excited to try the “core” pints. The picture they show online makes it look like a decent size and width. The reality: the core of my salted caramel pint was the width of a pencil eraser tip. Incredibly disappointing and 100% not as advertised. I feel duped.
0_bj,2018-06-19,3,Core-full?,"I bought this on sale and was excited to try it. While the ice cream is light and blondies are a nice treat, I wish there was more of a salted caramel core. Mine did not go down even halfway, which is a pity because I love salted caramel."
0_bj,2017-10-14,2,Not terrible,I had to buy this to since they were all out of mint at the store...lots of Carmel Core which was a plus but no blondie chunks!!! Any were so tiny...very disappointed because Ben and jerrys rocks!!
0_bj,2017-08-15,3,Why,I love this but where did my core go??????????????
0_bj,2018-02-07,3,Salty Caramel?,I know sweet cream ice cream probably wouldn't be a big seller but I wish B&J would make more flavors with a sweet cream base or just a plain sweet cream ice cream. When the flavor was 1st introduced I used to get this regularly but it got to a point I was throwing away most of the caramel because it was too salty. I will still occasionally purchase as there are no other flavors with sweet cream.
0_bj,2019-01-26,3,Too salty,"Bought this recently because my local target has stopped carrying Blondie Ambition, which was my favorite. I love the sweet-cream ice cream; my container didn't seem to have very many blondie chunks (which was disappointing, see previous) and the salted caramel core was overly salty. It was okay. I might buy it again but would rather have Blondie Ambition."
0_bj,2017-09-18,2,Ok..,"I really wanted to like this flavor but it was quite disappointing. Halfway into the pint, the core pretty much disappeared. There was way too much at the top and it wasn't dispersed evenly throughout the ice cream. The caramel was also way too salty for my tastes. Also wished there were more brownie pieces, only found a few in the entire pint."
0_bj,2017-09-13,3,Blonde brownies??,"Couldn't find any in my pint. But the rest is fabulous, don't change a thing!"
0_bj,2018-03-29,1,So disappointed!,"I had a major craving for ice cream so of course I had to go to the store for some Ben and Jerry's! I was really excited about this flavor, but after a few bites I was gagging. It was too salty and there were barely any brownie chunks :/ I'm really sad this ice cream is going to go waste, but I'm not happy with my purchase at all."
0_bj,2017-07-14,2,Blondie Crumbs,Just bought this last night and like some of the other reviews there were only a few flecks of blondie. Mine was nothing like the photos. And so the combination of just ice cream and such salty caramel was disappointing and unbalanced. I don't know if the core extended to the bottom since I didn't eat enough to find out.
0_bj,2018-05-06,2,So Disappointed :(,"I never thought I would not like a Ben & Jerry's flavor, but it's happened :( When my store didn't have my favorite flavor, I thought I would try the Salted Caramel Core - the description sounded great. Unfortunately, the caramel was *way* too salty - I ended up scooping it all out. The vanilla ice cream was good, but the brownie pieces had no flavor. I've never been disappointed by Ben & Jerry's before, but I guess there's a first for everything :("
0_bj,2018-07-07,2,They sure meant it when it said salted,"The salted caramel core tastes like someone went a little too salt happy. There was just too much core in ratio with the ice cream an in addition to the bad core to ice cream ratio, the core was just too salty to handle. Please fix the core because the ice cream itself with the blonde brownie bits are delicious."
0_bj,2019-02-14,1,"Horrible pint, bland brownies","I was excited for this ice cream because I love blondies and caramel, but it was the one flavor I've tried that I strongly dislike. The core didn't go deep at all and it was SO salty that it made me feel kind of sick. The brownies were dry and sparce and I barely could taste them. The base was alright, I guess. Really dissapointed. I think this flavor needs to be fixed or just stopped being made."
0_bj,2019-08-12,5,Best B&J Pint ever!,"I've been hooked on this flavor for more than 2 weeks now. I wish I'd have known about it sooner lol! The Salted Caramel Core is very good and the Blonde Brownies make this product over the top. I do have one complaint though. I buy maybe 4 pints or more a week and everytime I open one and start eating them they are all different as far as how many brownie peices there are or the caramel. Sometimes there's a ton of salted caramel at the top which can be overwhelming and then it's gone half way down. Other times it's normal until you get about halfway and there nothing but the sweet cream ice cream with no caramel or brownies. It's always different, however I'm still in love with this flavor and I highly recommend it! Please B&J see if y'all can get them all the same lol"
0_bj,2019-04-13,5,My Favorite Flavor,"I always wanted a flavor of ice cream that was taylored to the way my taste buds worked. Most ice cream flavors from other companies that have cookie dough in it is chocolate based, but this cookie dough is caramel and butter and cookie based (or boo die if that’s the correct term) I’ve been buying it almost every weekend at college for a year!
Please keep this flavor, it makes me so happy. The fact that there’s a cookie dough flavor that is chocolate free is one of a kind and not many ice companies make that!"
0_bj,2017-11-16,3,Too salty,"The blondie mix ins and sweet cream ice cream were nice, but I really wasn't a fan of the caramel core, because it was far too salty. You've got multiple reviews saying that it's too salty, please don't skim over those reviews. Please consider tweaking the recipe on this one so it's less salty."
0_bj,2018-06-07,2,Good in theory...,"I usually love salted caramel foods, and I adore Ben & Jerry's decadent ice creams. The ice cream was excellent, the brownie pieces were yummy, but the caramel tasted way too salty! The salt is supposed to compliment the caramel, not overpower it. I'm pretty disappointed."
0_bj,2018-04-04,3,Too salty,"I love anything caramel. I was super excited when I saw the whole core was salted caramel. However it was way too salty, I even tried mixing it with the sweet cream ice cream and it was still too salty. It could also use more of the brownie, which was certainly delicious."
0_bj,2017-06-08,5,My all time favorite ice cream!!!,"I.JUST.LOVE this ice cream!!! if I eat ice cream, it must always be B&J salted caramel core! I think I'm addicted. It's a perfect combination between sweet and salty, plus delicious caramel and chewy chunks. I noticed that some pints don't have that much chunks but the vanilla ice cream itself is pretty yummy and honestly, I cannot stay mad for long haha! If B&J's ever discontinue this flavor, I think it could be the end of my world!"
0_bj,2017-04-12,5,Absolutely fantastic,"I bought this ice cream simply based on the fact that I was craving caramel. But with this wonderful ice cream, you get so much more. Not only is the Ice cream and blonde Brownies perfect...but the caramel is just so good. You almost want to save the caramel as long as you can because how perfect the flavor is. It's the perfect amounts of sweet and salty."
0_bj,2018-03-08,1,Way too salty,"There must have been some sort of mistake with the amount of salt mixed into the caramel. Nobody would but that much saint into a desert. The pint it's still on our freezer. On a side note, Cherry Garcia is the best ice cream ever made."
0_bj,2018-03-09,2,SALTY!!!,Tried this flavor for the first time about two weeks ago it was delicious; But today I’m extremely disappointed. The core is so salty in this pint. I had other people try and they also agreed it was too salty. Don’t think I’m buying again.
0_bj,2018-09-07,2,Too salty,"I am a lover of all things caramel, and while the ice cream and the blonde bites were delicious, I found myself eating around the core because it was just too salty. Tasted like caramel flavored salt. Very disappointed in this flavor."
0_bj,2017-06-05,5,I love it I love it.,Salted caramel core is in my top three. My eating tactic is to scoop the ice cream from the outside and then smash the back of the spoon into the core so when I take a bite the first thing I'm hit with is salty and then it's sweet.
0_bj,2018-06-03,1,Horrible!,"My daughter picked up this flavor for me to try because I love Carmel. I have to say, this is the worst flavor I have ever had. The blonde fudge was bland but the salted Carmel was the worst. It was so salty that I couldn't eat it."
0_bj,2018-09-23,2,Has potential,"I love Ben & Jerry and was excited about the Salted Caramel Core, BUT the caramel is WAY to salty. I even tried to eat it with more ice cream But the salty flavor is too powerful. Disappointed, I know Ben & Jerry could do better !"
0_bj,2017-06-07,2,Caramel core was WAY to salty.,"Tried this for the very first time today. The caramel core was extremely salty. Way to salty to actually enjoy the caramel. Left a bad after taste.
On a positive note, the core was gooey and easy to scoop out with a spoon."
0_bj,2017-05-21,1,Not a fan of brownie chunks,I really can't stand the flavors with chunks of cookie/brownie. It seems like I'm eating something stale. I'm in the minority but I stopped going to a convenience store near me because all they carried were those types.
0_bj,2019-01-28,3,Too Salty for my buds,"I had high hopes for this flavor, but the carmel core was way too salty. I was hoping for a sweeter kraft caramel taste. The blonde brownie bites were just okay...not much traditional brownie flavor. Won’t buy again."
0_bj,2018-02-11,1,Don’t buy this one!,I absolutely love Ben and Jerrys ice cream but this one was horrible. The picture looks like there will be tons and brownies and there were only 5 tiny bites in the whole pint. The caramel core was overly salty too.
0_bj,2018-09-14,2,Where did the core go???,"So this used to be one of my favourite flavours! The Caramel is very salty and the blondie bits are very chewy but i love that!
The disappointment comes in the fact that the first few times i got this the core went right through to the very bottom! A thick gooey caramel all they way to the last bite. Each time I have gotten this since I have found the caramel to end sooner and sooner in the pint. This last container the caramel went about half way through .
Please bring back the core!!"
0_bj,2017-07-27,3,Core is misleading,"I enjoyed the of flavor of the ice cream. But I was expecting much more caramel. When the label reads ""Salted Caramel Core"", I expected the caramel to be from the top to the bottom. At least that's what I think of the core to be. Like an apple core, it's in the middle from top to bottom. The core is the center of things."
0_bj,2019-07-12,1,the worst thing to ever be in my mouth,the caramel tastes like salty death. I think I have sodium poisoning from one bite. Gross as heck like why would you do this to people. Who let this pass the taste test??? Fr fr are y’alls tongues blind?
0_bj,2017-10-30,3,Used to love! Keyword’s “used to”,"I found the salted caramel core shortly after discovering Karamel Sutra. Needless to say I fell in love! The flavors were amazing and the gooey salted caramel and blondie chunks went perfect together. Until the last 12, yes I said 12! Pints I bought, all fell short. They either had very few brownie chunks, the core stopped halfway through, or there was a pocket of air at the bottom where caramel should have been. I give up! I want my salted caramel, but not at 4.50/pt to be left unhappy."
0_bj,2017-10-17,2,Didn't like it,"I tried this ice cream when it first came out, didn't care for it. It seemed as though it was missing something and I really didn't like the salted caramel. I like the Karamel Sutra much better."
0_bj,2017-07-14,3,"Good ice cream, too salty","The sweet cream and blondie chunks were delicious, but the core was almost too salty to eat. The taste of salt was completely overpowering the caramel flavor. Good overall, just needs less salt."
0_bj,2018-08-11,1,Too salty,The core just tastes like salt with no caramel flavour. The ice-cream was floury & the blonde brownie pieces had no taste. Worst flavour I’ve ever had. Very disappointed. :(
0_bj,2018-02-21,4,Love this-but need more,"I purchase this flavor A LOT. Probably too much honestly. I have lived this for a while. Recently the punts seem to be lacking be caramel core to the bottom of the pint and the blondies are missing. There’s like 2 spoons of the caramel and 3 pieces of blondie.
Like I said before, I live this flavor. I just hope the manufacturing can go back to when I first found this flavor and fell in love!"
0_bj,2019-06-24,3,Meh!,The ice-cream is disappointingly tasteless...why not use vanilla. The caramel us too salty and intense...why not swirled? The brownie bites were few and far between.
0_bj,2017-06-19,2,"Brownies good, Caramel not so much",I love Ben and Jerrys! The brownies and ice cream were very good! The caramel was just overwhelmingly salty. I couldn't even eat it. Maybe it's just not for me. :(
0_bj,2018-07-15,1,Very salty,I had looked forward to trying this flavor but found the core saltier than the ocean. As someone who loves caramel this is the worst caramel I have ever tried. I
0_bj,2017-10-05,2,SALTY!!,"Typically I love salted caramel desserts (or caramel in general), so when I saw this ice cream I was eager to try it. That caramel core nearly knocked me over with its saltiness!! For me, it overpowered the combined flavor of sweet cream, brownies and caramel. I agree with the other reviewers, vanilla ice cream might have been a better balance. However, I do like the blondies. So close!! :-("
0_bj,2018-09-09,3,Almost Delicious,"the flavors are great and they work well together. Unfortunately, they do not work well with the core concept. The caramel would be much better if it were evenly distributed throughout the ice cream, rather than isolated in one huge pool. The blondies could pack a bit more flavor as well. So far, I have yet to have a variety of Ben & Jerry's core flavors that would not taste better if the flavors were evenly distributed. They almost taste like a cheap Ben & Jerry's knockoff."
0_bj,2017-06-27,2,Great but really salty in the caramel core...,I bought this favor couple of days ago and thought what could be bad about a salted caramel core. Everything was great except the core was so salty that it drowned out the other favors. I do mean salty the 180 mg are in the caramel core. It left a nasty taste in my mouth. Anybody who needs to watch there salt intake shouldn't eat this ice cream favor.
0_bj,2017-06-15,2,Salt core?,"I bought this the other day and was so excited, but when I tried it, the core was way too salty. I love salted caramel, and all the other reviews rave about the core so I'm pretty confused.. Maybe I got a bad pint but it was like salt with an essence of caramel. Sooo overpoweringly salty; first time I've avoided a swirl or core :("
0_bj,2019-11-21,5,Please never discontinue.,"I don't even understand how anyone could have anything bad to say about this ice cream. The sweat cream base is just the right about of sweet. The salted caramel core is almost bitter on it's own but when paired together they are such a great couple, plus the blondie bites! I am a digger and I never run out of these delicious gems. I will cry If they discontinue this one. For someone that doesn't want an overly sweet ice cream this is perfect."
0_bj,2020-05-12,5,Perfect combination!,Honestly have no idea why people are complaining about this. There couldn’t have been a better pairing of delicious succulent sweet cream ice cream paired with blonde brownies and topped off with savoring salted caramel to make your taste buds smile with such joy. I’ve been buying a pint every week for the past 3 months and haven’t had the urge to try a different flavor. Please don’t ever discontinue this flavor it makes belly very happy
0_bj,2017-05-04,3,Shaken to the Core,"My husband was away for the evening, and I felt like a little R&R so I headed to the store for some trusty B&J. I decided to go for a flavor I'd never tried. The description sounded so delicious. And delicious it was! Until, I discovered the core was no more than a dollop on top. At about an inch deep it just vanished, leaving me with nothing but the ice cream and blondies... pretty good stuff, but I'm disappointed at the lack of core."
0_bj,2018-04-19,2,Too Salty,"That Salted Carmel Core is WAY WAY too Salty. I tired this when it firs came out and I hate it because it was too salty, but I decided to give it another try to see if the formula had been tweaked.. and nope, it has not. So So SO salty. Like others below, I scooped out the core and ate around what I could."
0_bj,2017-07-14,5,Great ice cream,"This flavor is magnificent. The sweet cream ice cream works perfectly with the caramel and blondies. And the blondies are particularly great - soft and flavorful. I'm always scared that this flavor will go to the graveyard. Please, Ben and Jerry's, don't discontinue salted caramel core!"
0_bj,2018-02-21,3,My parents by was disappointing,"I wanted to try something new and thought this looked delicious. It was REALLY good, but less than half way down the “core” literally disappeared. I mean, the ice cream and blonde chi class were good. But I really bought it for the caramel core and kind of feel like I got jipped."
0_bj,2018-05-02,5,THEE BEST HANDS DOWN,"I LOVE this flavor!!!
I have been addicted to this since 2016!!!
It surpasses anything like it!
I love salted caramel ice cream. However it’s hard finding one WITHOUT chocolate!!!
Chocolate overwhelms the salted caramel for me!
However, salted caramel core gets it right!!!
The blondie bites are the cherry on top!
Please don’t ever discontinue this flavor!!!
If I could afford to purchase every pint, I would!!!"
0_bj,2020-06-12,2,I wanted to like it...,"I really wanted to like this ice cream because I'm a die hard B&J's fan! However it just wasn't that great. The ice cream base was very yummy, it wasn't an overpowering flavor and the blondie chucks were very good! But the center, tasted like pure table salt and sugar mixed. It really was over the top salts to the point where I just ended up eating around it...I wish I would have gotten another flavor if I had known."
0_bj,2019-05-24,4,What happened to the blondes bites?,"This was my favorite Ben and Jerry's flavor. I still love the sweet cream ice-cream and I adore the caramel core, but something happened to the blonde brownie pieces. They used to be soft and chewy, perfect texture and delicious. The texture has changed now they are hard and crumbly very disappointing. Thought it was a fluke but the last maybe 5 pints I've had from different stores have all had the same issue."
0_bj,2017-05-08,2,Delicious brownies but caramel is disgusting,I bought this last night and was very excited to try. Brownie was great but caramel was so salty that I couldn't even eat it. It was like someone poured a salt shaker's worth of salt into it. Did anyone else have this experience?
0_bj,2019-05-04,5,SO GOOD.,"I've already told my husband that I just might cry if this flavor is ever discontinued. And we would need another freezer so I can stock up on pints. To the reviewers saying this mix would be better with vanilla ice cream, you need to check your taste buds! The sweet cream complements the salted caramel core so wonderfully. Although I will agree with others - more blonde brownie chunks please!"
0_bj,2020-08-08,5,THE BEST!,"This is truly my favorite ice cream flavor! I have introduced several friends to it, and they love it just as much! I introduced my husband to it when we were dating, and we actually had salted caramel core pints at our wedding instead of cake. The salted caramel is perfect for salted caramel lovers, and the blonde brownies are the best addition! I would 10/10 recommend this goodness."
0_bj,2020-04-10,5,The best thing I’ve ever put in my mouth,This was the best ice cream I’ve ever tasted. The salted Carmel mixed with the sweet cream ice cream is Devine. When you hit a blonde piece it’s the most delicious mouth watering bite. I would recommend this ice cream to everyone I know. I could live off of this for the rest of my life and be content. I stalked up on these pints during quarantine. Ben and Jerry please sponsor me.
0_bj,2020-06-11,1,Salted caramel with emphasis on the SALTED,"The core concept is great because you get a lot of one key component. I normally love salted caramel. However, the caramel core in this ice cream is so salty I can't eat it. It isn't even a matter of mixing it together with the other ingredients to maybe make it taste better than it does in isolation. The salt just overpowers everything!"
0_bj,2017-10-17,5,Excellent blend of flavors,I’m tempted to give a bad review to see if they “reach out to me to make it right” by giving free ice cream...
0_bj,2018-04-29,1,Tastes spoiled,"I got a pint of this ice cream and i had to throw it out. It had an awful taste and the brownies were really gross and chewy; I spit it out and it left an awful after-taste. I checked the date on the carton and it’s good until 2019, so I’m not sure what happened but the ice cream was the worst I’ve ever eaten. Won’t get that again."
0_bj,2019-03-18,5,Possibly my favorite flavor!!,"I'm very surprised by the low reviews on this flavor. It is absolutely delicious. The caramel core is what makes this one so special. You can enjoy it all the way down to the end of the pint. It could use more blondie chunks (bigger ones, too) but this didn't detract enough for me to take away any stars. I LOVE this flavor."
0_bj,2018-03-05,4,Taste Amazing BUT...,I love the flavor combo of this ice cream but I just wanted more brownie pieces. I found myself trying to dig out what few pieces were in middle of my pint. Just a little disappointed. I just wanted more :( The overall taste of the ice cream was on point. I don't think a little more brownie chunks will mess that up. Thanks!
0_bj,2017-08-22,4,Almost perfect!,"Ok so this was my first 'core' Ben and Jerry's. It was awesome. I love the experience of mixing the ice cream with the caramel. But where were the blondies? They were few and far between each bite. I was very excited about it everytime I managed to find a small piece. Also, are the blondies made by Greyston Bakery?"
0_bj,2018-01-22,5,Best ice cream in the history of cream!,My husband brought it home a few months ago and now im addicted! It's so good i as in hospital having brain surgery and it's all I wanted! I give up meals so i can eat it. I don't like chocolate so it's so hard to find blonde brownies and salted carmel without chocolate. If I had a last meal it would be it!
0_bj,2019-09-03,5,My Favorite Core Ice Cream!,"This one is my favorite out of the cores! I'm a lover of caramel and a lover of blondie brownies so of course this is a win! I can't see how the average rating is only 3.5. I don't get it. I don't know what people are tasting, because this is delicious. PLEASE don't get rid of this flavor!! I NEED it!"
0_bj,2017-05-25,4,Love salted caramel core!!!!,"Been buying this since it came out and lately the core has been less and less each time I buy it. The core only goes 1/2 inch and then none. Wish the core would go to the bottom of the container. Please keep the same ingredient but more core caramel!
Would give it five stars with more caramel!"
0_bj,2017-11-12,5,SO GOOD,"I LOVE this flavour. Salted caramel and blonde brownies are my favourite thing, and to find them in ice cream was a dream come true. The only thing I wish was different: I know ""Salted"" Caramel is the name of the flavour, but it really was too salty - so much so that I found it kind of off-putting."
0_bj,2017-10-04,2,"Great potential, but lacking in brownies.","Tastes great and has so much potential, but the 6 pints of ice cream that I bought-all had a core of caramel with a couple of blonde brownies but nothing like I expected. It fell short of my expectations and I can't justify spending $5 a pint for ice cream that isn't chock-full of gooey goodness."
0_bj,2020-04-22,3,Finally something not chocolate!,This was a dream come true when I found it in stores. I was so excited!! I barely made it home. BUT... disappointment hit me in the face when I almost died at how salty the caramel is. Wow. Not enough brownies. I guess I'll keep searching for my perfect flavor. I wish you could Exchange icecream.
0_bj,2019-01-24,5,My favorite,"My favorite flavour from ben&jerry’s! The salted caramel tastes amazing with the cream ice cream and i love the blondie brownies too. I live in europe and they do not have this flavour in finland, which makes me so sad :(
But every time i come to the states i buy it, because it tastes so good."
0_bj,2018-09-08,2,Hard Blondie Pieces,"We have been buying this ice cream since it first debuted. It was our family favorite, hoewever, the last 6 pints we’ve bought have had hard, crunchy blondie bits instead of the soft, chewy pieces we knew and loved. This is such a disappointment and sadly, will make us stop buying this."
0_bj,2020-07-13,5,Life changing,"Truly. I’m in recovery from anorexia nervosa and you better believe that I’ve inhaled a pint of this ice cream every single day!!! The perfect ratio of salted caramel to smooth vanilla ice cream, and the brownie bits provide a nice touch of goodness.
Ben and Jerry’s: 1
Anorexia: 0"
0_bj,2019-03-31,4,Tastes Great but Caramel is too Salty,I got this a few days ago just to try. I really loved it!! The blondie brownies are so yummy. I really enjoyed the ice cream overall. However the salted caramel core was a little too salty for the ice cream. I couldn’t really eat all the caramel with the ice cream like I wanted too
0_bj,2020-07-10,5,Can’t get enough of this ice cream,"This ice cream. Y’all. This ice cream. The perfectly salted gooey caramel, the chewy chunks of blondie... ermahgerd. The worst part of this is we can barely find it anymore. BEN AND JERRY I swear to you if you get rid of this in the middle of a pandemic... I will never forgive you."
0_bj,2017-05-20,4,"Really, Really GOOD","I am writing this review as I enjoy a pint of this very ice cream. It is delicious and the flavors go very well together. The only problem was, though, that the caramel was waaay too salty, so I ended up eating around it. Nontheless, it was really good and I hope to buy it again."
0_bj,2017-10-25,3,good but can use a little help,I think the sweet cream and caramel are great but I have bought this a couple times and the brownies just are off on taste. I feel like choc brownies would be better or to even leave them out. Far from gross but not as good as other ice cream which is a bummer with the price.
0_bj,2020-04-23,5,Perfection!!,"By far my favorite pint ever! Not to mention, SUPER addicting!!! The blond brownies are the beeeeessst, and with caramel? Truly my only companion in this quarantine, so i stocked up. World War IV could break out and as long as I have my daily B&J pints I’d survive just fine."
0_bj,2017-06-04,1,Caramel Core????,I bought this for the caramel core the first time and it was great. The second time with was a dollop of caramel on top. The third time an even smaller dollop. If you like just vanillia ice cream a little bit of caramel this is the ice cream for you. I am very disappointed.
0_bj,2020-04-25,5,It’s my favorite!,I bought this about a month ago and have gotten two more containers since. I would not say it’s a flavor for everyone but I love it. I love salted Carmel. The salt pairs nicely with the sweet ice cream and blondies! But if you don’t like salty sweetness this is not for you.
0_bj,2018-12-15,4,Perfect,"I am allergic to coco beans so finding a tasty ice cream with out any chocolate can become quite the hassle. When I, thankfully, came across this ice cream I was over the moon. The only problem I have with it is that I can't find it in any stores when I go search for it."
0_bj,2018-06-30,2,"Disappointed, false advertising","First time buying a pint of salted caramel core. I was so excited! I immediately noticed a lack of blonde brownies and about half way through the pint, the caramel core disappeared. It looks nothing like the picture! There was a total of maybe 5 or 6 blondie pieces."
0_bj,2020-09-03,5,Salted Caramel with blonde brownies!!!,"Salted caramel + blonde brownies + B&J ice cream = what I plan to replace my blood with.
If you LOVE sweet & salty this was made for you. If you haven't tried salted caramel with blondies, Do. It. Now. You have not lived & I weep for you, you poor unfortunate soul!"
0_bj,2017-08-05,4,"First time wasn't love, second time was love!",The first time I tried this I thought it was wayyy too salty. I gave it another try a few weeks later and I love it now. The trick is to have a tiny bite of caramel with the ice cream since sometimes the core has a lot of caramel and sometimes it just has a little.
0_bj,2018-12-31,3,Incredibly Sweet,"I usually get salted caramel core when none of my favorite flavors are available. Even though it's a last resort for me, I still enjoy the sweetness of the vanilla, the chewiness of the blonde brownies, and the incredibly rich caramel. It blend together perfectly."
0_bj,2020-04-26,2,"Great concept, salty execution","I really love salted caramel and blondes. I think in this pint, though, that the caramel is wayyyyy too overpowering and there are too few blondies to enjoy. I ate around the caramel, but as the core spread through the rest, it ruined the ice cream in my opinion."
0_bj,2019-10-29,3,Not enough Caramel or brownies,I think it should be a little more brownies and Carmel all the way to the bottom so you can have a little bit of caramels and brownie with each bite after a few scoops mine didn’t have any more brownies like it was only brownies in the top layer of ice cream
0_bj,2019-01-25,2,Lack of caramel,I bought this for the first time tonight 1/23/19 and was super excited because I love salted caramel ice cream. Upon opening the product I noticed that the ice cream had no caramel in it whatsoever. Highly disappointed especially for the price of a pint.
0_bj,2017-06-15,3,A Caramel Lover's Dream (With A Catch),"This ice cream is very tasty with the caramel core. However, my core only went halfway through and then stopped. I also wish the chewy bits were a little more flavorful and thicker. Other than being cheated on the core, I really enjoyed this ice cream."
0_bj,2019-02-05,5,Best Ice Cream EVER!!,I have been obsessed with this flavor since the first time i had it! It's all about balancing the sweet cream and the caramel! Too much caramel might be too salty but too much cream might be too sweet. It a balance and extraordinary once you find it!
0_bj,2019-04-16,5,MY FAVORITE,"This is one of my favorite ice cream flavors of all time. The caramel is yes, salted! But I personally love the saltier caramel with the sweet creamy ice cream. And the blondie brownies are so YUM! I will be sad if they ever stopped making this one."
0_bj,2018-04-21,2,Barely any blonde chunks and core stopped,I was so excited to try this but I had barely any blond or chuncks in my ice cream and the core stopped half way through!! I thought the core was supposed to to all the way to the bottom. Very upset and this was my first time trying Ben and Jerry’s
0_bj,2019-04-17,5,Best Flavor Ever,"I love this flavor, it is now my go to! It is the perfect mix of sweet and salty, only sometimes issue is that the core occasionally stops before the end of the carton. It doesn't matter to me though because I still love the brownies in it!"
0_bj,2019-11-27,5,Love this ice cream flavor,This is the absolute best flavor!!!! I love how creamy the ice cream is. The brownies are absolutely amazing full of flavor and very soft!! The caramel is super salty and sweet it's SOO GOOD I'm obsessed. Don't ever change the ingredients!!
0_bj,2017-07-26,4,Salted Caramel,"As somebody who grew up on Ben & Jerry's I have been spoiled by so many delicious blends. However, this one was very tasty, but disappointing because the core kept getting smaller until disappearing halfway through and so did the brownies."
0_bj,2017-04-27,3,It was good but..,"I just actually finished a pint of this and while I like the idea and the flavors, it was very off balanced flavor wise. I can't tell if it was just my pint or what but it was overwhelmingly salty with little to none blonde chunks );"
0_bj,2019-10-23,1,Disgusting,"I have loved b&j for many years. My favorite of course which is gone was Wavy Gravy. I bought this flavor because Karmal Sutra wasn't available, this is nothing like it, gagged on the first bite of Karmel SSSOOO salty!!!!!! Yuch"
0_bj,2018-05-12,2,Great flavor but not much of a core,"Unlike other reviewers, I enjoyed the flavor of the salted caramel. I didn’t find it too overpowering. I just wish the core made it all the way to the bottom of the pint. The pint I ate only had caramel at the very top"
0_bj,2018-12-22,5,Amazing icecream but needs a little more brownie,I brought this so manny times I love it really but the thing about it is that it needs a little more brownie dough in there and honestly I love the Carmel center but it’s just the brownies that need a little bit more
0_bj,2017-05-12,3,Where's the rest of the core??,"I loved this ice cream when I stared the pint but not even halfway through, the caramel core just stopped! I had to be a bad batch because no way that's how it's supposed to be. Sad because that was my favorite part!"
0_bj,2017-05-08,3,Not enough chunks,Bought this last night and while the flavor was great there were literally only 5 chunks of blondies throughout the whole pint. I wish there were a lot more as it would have make the eating experience more enjoyable
0_bj,2017-06-26,5,Wonderful ice cream!,"This is becoming my favorite ice cream, and one that I have come to crave. The only thing that would make it better would be more of the caramel - Ben and Jerry's makes the best caramel in ice cream I've ever had!"
0_bj,2020-04-24,1,No Caramel flavor,"I love anything caramel. Tried this flavor years ago - core was like creamy salt. ! Gave it another try recently thinking it may have just been a bad batch, but again, nothing caramel about it. Will not buy again!"
0_bj,2019-09-08,5,Love This!!!,This is one of the main Ice Creams that I purchase from Ben & Jerry's!! Absolutely the BEST is you like Salted Carmel. I do not understand why the rating is not higher??? But PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE this flavor. <3
0_bj,2020-09-19,5,My Go-to Ice Cream,I buy this all the time because it's so delicious. The salted caramel and blondies create a tasty melange of awesome flavors. It's my favorite! I highly recommend it!!
0_bj,2017-07-14,1,Least favorite,"I bought this last night, the ""core"" barely even went halfway down the pint and there were only a couple chunks of brownie. Didn't even finish it, lacked excitement as all i was left with was vanilla ice cream."
0_bj,2019-08-16,5,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING,this is the best flavor of Ben & Jerry’s by far. If you’re complaining I don’t trust you; this is seriously the most addicting flavor. If they stop making this flavor I’ll cry. Soooooooooooo goooooooodddddddd
0_bj,2017-08-28,5,Love the caramel core,"I'm a big salty/sweet fan so this ice cream is perfect for me. I see people complaining about how salty the caramel is, but that's honestly my favorite part about it! Devouring a pint as I type this review."
0_bj,2020-05-11,3,Not so good for the first try,Today was my first time trying it and I’m a little disappointed I thought this would be “ salty “ but NOT THAT EXTREME SALTY. I wish it was less salty don’t get me wrong I love caramel but this was to much !
0_bj,2018-09-19,5,Love the salted caramel!,"Due to health issues, I cannot eat chocolate, so this ice cream is a lifesaver! It's sweet, the caramel is outrageously soft and delicious, and the brownies offer a great bit of texture. I love it!"
0_bj,2017-09-22,5,Seriously Delicious,I think this is my first time writing a review for ice cream. But this flavor is just amazing. The chewy brownies are delicious and I love salted caramel. Perfect amount of salt in my opinion.
0_bj,2018-12-26,5,It's Very Simple...,"If you like Baskin & Robbins' ""Pralines & Cream"" ice cream flavor, you will LOVE Ben & Jerry's Salted Caramel Core! However, be careful: It will add the weight on you -- it is just THAT good!"
0_bj,2017-08-28,4,Love this flavor,I love this flavor so much! I just wish the caramel core went all the way to the bottom. About half way down the pint the caramel goes away! It's so sad because this flavor is delicious!
0_bj,2017-12-13,5,Heaven on Earth,I'm not sure how this flavor is rated so low! It is life changing.
0_bj,2019-01-08,5,My absolute favorite!,"I love vanilla ice cream based flavors and this one is the best. Blond brownies, ice cream and caramel are a great flavor combination. It is hard to stop eating it once I have started!"
0_bj,2017-11-30,5,DEFINITELY GONNA GET THIS AGAIN,"I bought this a less then a month ago and I can't stop thinking about it ahhhhhh soooo gooood but another one I really recommend is ""the tonight dough"" I rate that a 12/10 sooooo good"
0_bj,2018-05-20,5,Best Flavor EVER!!,Absolutely wonderful use of the core to have a luscious slug of salted caramel drilled down the center!!! Awesomeness!!! I will buy this flavor forever as long as it is available!
0_bj,2020-09-06,5,Best Ben & Jerrys Flavor ever!,Please never stop making this flavor! The salted core is perfect if you get a small amount of core on each spoonful along with a chunk of blonde with the ice cream it is to die for!
0_bj,2017-08-09,5,My Favorite Ever!!!!!,I buy this ice cream maybe twice a week but the last two purchases haven't had caramel completely to the bottom and not enough blonde bits.....I don't know why but I still love it
0_bj,2017-10-26,5,Great Taste!,"I bought it accidentally for my Birthday - I wanted something else - but, it is not that bad what I expected about the taste of caramel! More than likely I would buy it again."
0_bj,2019-01-28,5,Perfection achieved!!!,This has the perfect example of what salted caramel should be. Smooth and silky with a salt/sweet balance that's downright addictive. Had to force myself away from the carton.
0_bj,2017-05-05,5,"Best Ice Cream, Ever!!",I wish I had something bad to say about this flavor just so I can get coupons for MORE!! LOL I've never run across a bad batch. It's always DeLiCiOuS!! Thank you so much!!
0_bj,2019-02-24,5,Melody of flavors,The salted caramel core reaches my soul. The addition of sweet cream ice cream and blonde brownie bits complement the salted caramel as a perfect masterpiece of flavors.
0_bj,2020-07-15,5,Can’t Get Enough,I am so in love with this ice cream. Must always have some with me. The sweet cream ice cream combined with the blondie pieces and caramel are a match made in heaven!
0_bj,2017-12-31,5,Love it,This one is by far in my top five. I once had a flavor with honey bun pieces and caramel and was obsessed with it but this one by far blows that one out of the water
0_bj,2019-01-16,2,Bummed about lack of swirl and blondie,"Ben and Jerry’s has never let me down until now! Huge fan of the other flavors, but this was lacking with the burst of mix ins we all have come to know and love."
0_bj,2020-08-12,5,Perfection,"This is hands down my favorite flavor! I'm not a chocolate fan, so I appreciate every aspect of this. Each ingredient shines, but I love a good blondie chunk!"
0_bj,2017-05-27,5,THE BEST,After trying dozens of flavors this is the one I keep going back to. The caramel core is divine and there's enough to go with every bite. I LOVE THIS FLAVOR
0_bj,2017-08-06,2,Not so great,Very little caramel in the core. There wasn't any caramel until half way down. I've wanted to try the core flavors for a long time now. Won't buy again.
0_bj,2018-08-22,5,My new favorite!!,What’s not to love? I’m completely addicted to this ice cream. I fight with my husband when I feel he’s eating more than his fair share of the core.
0_bj,2019-01-25,5,Favorite Flavor,This is hands down my favorite flavor of ice cream! Please don’t ever get rid of this! I would sell my souls for a pint of Salted Caramel Core!
0_bj,2018-08-13,4,too salty and not enough brownie,I love the sweet cream and the blonde but the caramel is too salty and there isn’t enough brownie bits in it! Other than that it is DELICIOUS!
0_bj,2019-02-24,5,"Y'all are crazy, this is great","I love this flavor. The intense saltiness of the caramel is my favorite feature, and the blondie bits are divine. I eat it all the time."
0_bj,2020-09-20,5,best caramel I've ever tasted,this is the perfect ice cream if you are a caramel lover - that's it!
0_bj,2018-05-11,5,One of my favorites,"I love salted carmel, sometimes it doesn't have a lot of brownies and caramel. If they could make that more consitant would be awesome."
0_bj,2018-02-14,5,"My favorite, love alllll the caramel",I love the salted caramel core. It’s the best part. Hard to find ice cream with no chocolate but I finally have and it’s the best.
0_bj,2019-04-14,5,The best!,"This is by far my favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor! Love the caramel core, perfectly gooey and the blonde brownies are sooo good!"
0_bj,2017-10-04,5,Wonderful taste with maximum flavour!,"It's the second time in a row that I buy this ice cream, and I dont seem to get tired of it :)
Just ate it a minute ago :))))"
0_bj,2018-05-24,5,My Favorite!!!,"This flavor is my absolute favorite ice cream! It's so amazing! Sadly however, they stopped selling it in my local stores RIP"
0_bj,2019-05-23,5,Best Flavor Ever,"I tried this for the first time last week, and now I'm hooked. The ice cream alone is great, and the caramel core is amazing!"
0_bj,2020-06-27,5,My favorite flavor!,"My mom and I always get this one every time we go to the store. There's a lot of caramel, but it doesn't overpower you."
0_bj,2019-01-01,1,More Like 1/2 Core!,Caramel “core” completely ended less than half way through. What a joke! Apparently no quality control being done.
0_bj,2018-04-02,5,AMAZING,This is the best ice cream ever. I am a fan. 10 out 10. Everyone should get it. Please let me sponsor this flavor.
0_bj,2020-05-11,5,Favorite one!!,"I try new flavors, but always get this one too. It is the best flavor in my opinion. The caramel is delicious!!!"
0_bj,2020-07-26,5,"Best of the ""Core"" line!","I am giving it a full 5 because it is the best of this line. That said, I do wish there was more brownie bits!"
0_bj,2018-10-01,5,My Favorite!,This is my absolute favorite flavor.. please don’t ever take this away! I love the caramel core. The best!!!
0_bj,2018-06-13,5,BEST ICE CREAM EVER,"BEST ICE CREAM , IT IS DEFINITELY MY FAVORITE. ONLY THING THAT WOULD MAKE IT PERFECT WAS DOUBLE THE CARAMEL."
0_bj,2018-01-16,1,Where are the brownies?,I bought this yesterday after some convincing and I'm disappointed I had maybe 4 brownie chunks in mine :(
0_bj,2017-07-11,5,Mmmmmm...,I love the sweet and salt combination! Need more quart containers in you inventory besides Cherry Garcia!
0_bj,2018-02-06,5,the blondie and the center,It has a delicious flavor and It is so creamy and good The only word I can think of to describe it is YUM
0_bj,2019-02-26,5,This one is my favorite!,If you love salted caramel this is the way to go! And I love the blonde brownie bits in the ice cream
0_bj,2017-05-18,4,Perfect except for lack of core,I thought the core would go all the way through. It was only about an inch deep. Delicious otherwise.
0_bj,2017-12-14,5,Amazing,"I've had this multiple times at our school store, and it's delicious. I could eat everyday, honestly."
0_bj,2017-11-22,5,Mmm,Got this as a surprise and loved it! The salted Carmel core with the blondies was my favorite part
0_bj,2019-01-07,5,The best ice cream ever!,My husband and I had this on our vacation in Myrtle Beach a couple of days ago and it was awesome!
0_bj,2020-02-20,5,It is so good omlll,This is one of my top three favorite Ben and Jerry’s flavor and definitely my favorite core flavor
0_bj,2017-04-24,3,Ok,The flavor and idea is amazing but it wasn't enough brownies for me won't plan on buying again
0_bj,2017-11-05,2,Not good.,The pieces in the ice cream are very dry and crusty. Not good. The core is pretty good tho!
0_bj,2020-06-09,5,It hits,"This flavor was exceptional imo, the salty caramel in the center was generous and so good!"
0_bj,2020-06-19,5,"Extra creamy, perfect amount of caramel","Extra creamy, perfect amount of caramel, not too sweet. This one is my absolute favorite."
0_bj,2018-08-16,5,SO. MUCH. CARAMEL!,Love all the caramel down the middle of the pint! Great flavor without being too rich.
0_bj,2017-04-20,5,Salted caramel,Really good ice cream. Highly recommend it. The caramel core really tops it off. 9/10.
0_bj,2020-06-16,5,Caramel Lover,Love everything about this caramel core!!! I am a caramel lover and this hits the spot
0_bj,2019-09-12,5,Awesome mixture of flavors!,This is one of my top 3 favorites!!!!! Love the blonde brownie with caramel!!!!!!!!
0_bj,2017-06-14,5,Perfect combination!,It has all the good stuff! The flavors and gobs of blonde brownie are the best!!!
0_bj,2018-07-15,2,Core doesn't go down to bottom,Core doesn't go down to bottom and isn't in the center also caramel is too salty
0_bj,2020-07-22,5,DELICIOUS!,"OMG, I have tried this by mistake & it is now my fave!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
0_bj,2020-01-16,5,AMAZING,MY NEW FAVORITE FLAVOR. this was the most amazing ice cream i have ever tasted!

0_bj,2017-10-22,5,My new favorite!,Just the right blend of salty and sweet with silky smooth vanilla ice cream!
0_bj,2020-07-19,5,OMG!!!!,This was my first time trying this brand and I am in love with this flavor!
0_bj,2020-08-03,1,Lacking Flavor,"Caramel was lacking, brownies had no flavor, mostly vanilla ice cream only"
0_bj,2019-12-21,2,Taste,I thought the Carmel tasted burnt. There wasn’t enough other flavor.
0_bj,2017-07-21,5,Best ice cream in the world!!,I just ate this and did not want it to end. Must try before you die
0_bj,2020-08-25,5,My favorite flavor,I’ve been obsessed with this flavor for Months . It’s amazing
0_bj,2019-02-02,2,I love it but,I can't find it in Houston anywhere for the last 6 months
0_bj,2017-08-04,5,Caramel dreams!,The gooey caramel makes this pint my personal favorite!
0_bj,2017-07-28,5,Tasty!,Addictive!!! Love this flavor! True Caramel fans only!
0_bj,2018-07-15,5,Anyone who says it’s bad is a liar.,"It’s amazing, the best ice cream possibly of all time."
0_bj,2017-11-17,5,Decadent,Can’t get enough! Best ice cream I have ever tasted❤️
0_bj,2018-04-23,5,The Best!,My favorite ice cream of all time! I’m in love! Truly!
0_bj,2020-06-27,5,Amazing,This ice cream is amazing. My whole family is obsessed
0_bj,2018-03-19,5,Perfect,THE BEST ICE CREAM EVER!
0_bj,2019-02-26,5,my current favorite flavor,I will buy amost anything with salted caramel in it
0_bj,2019-08-12,5,Delicious flavor,Amazing smooth caramel .... great job on this one!
0_bj,2019-06-19,5,Good stuff,My all time favorite I go out of my way to find it
1_bj,2020-03-01,5,"So simple, yet so effective.","Ben and Jerry's took the peanut butter/chocolate flavor and knocked it out the park yet again. The peanut butter ice cream is great as always, but combined with the pretzel swirls, the flavor is heightened to an amazing degree. A nice little crunch to the pretzels as well for texture. The brownies aren't quite as good as in other flavors but definitely plentiful and still tasty. Put em all together and you get a salty/sweet peanut butter and chocolate combination that just works. A great flavor."
1_bj,2020-03-31,5,THIS IS THE BEST ICE CREAM IVE EVER HAD,"The actual peanut butter ice cream is amazing, the brownie chunks taste like they were just cooked. The pretzel bits are the most amazing thing I have eaten, they are not too salty. They are not crunchy or too soft, evert time I get a bite with the pretzel in it I have to just stop and savor it. So far I have only found these at Target I have shared about eight pints in a couple weeks with my husband. Honestly it's the best ice cream I've ever had. Hard, soft, homemade, vegan or non, it's the best."
1_bj,2020-04-30,5,Awesome Flavor,I will start by saying that I'm not a peanut butter flavored ice cream fan(I'm an urban bourbon addict)the only reason I tried this flavor was I couldn't find my flavor. Boy did this flavor SURPRISE me. It's a must try.
1_bj,2020-07-13,5,Sweet and Salty Perfection,My top two favorites of all time are Tonight Dough and Chubby Hubby (tied for first place) and a close second place is Netflix & Chill’d! The brownie pieces were HUGE and the salty sweet combo was just perfection.
1_bj,2020-02-17,5,Perfect ice cream!,"This is EVERYTHING I want in ice cream! Peanut butter, sweet, salty & just enough chocolate. I hope it becomes a regular flavor."
1_bj,2020-06-08,4,Love it!,"I love the PB ice cream rather than another flavour with gobs of actual peanut butter* throughout the pint**. The saltiness of the pretzel and chewy bits of fudge make tis quite possibly my new fave-flave. But...Everytime I look at the red couch on the label i can't help but think of tomatoes and thats not a flavour combo I wanna try anytime soon.*** Yuck!
* Don't get me wrong, I loves me some PB gobs but we got enough of those.
** I know that its not a pint here in Canada. But it sounds better than ""2 cup tub o' B & J's""
*** If there IS a Tomato ice cream with chunks of marzipan and marshmallow swirl flavour in the works I'd beg you good folks to reconsider."
1_bj,2020-02-05,5,Amazing,I am in love with this flavor. I'm a big pb fan and it is very prominent.
1_bj,2020-04-03,5,An ALL TIME Favorite!!!!!!,"This is just simply amazing. I am not one for ice cream but this has changed my perspective, so many perfect flavors wrapped into one. Sweet yet salty, enough toppings in every bite. WOW! I look forward to this every night!"
1_bj,2020-06-17,2,Way too salty,"The peanut butter flavor is good and the ice cream is creamy, but the balance of salty to sweet is way off. This tastes like peanut butter ice cream with pure salt swirled through it. The brownies are soft but flavorless, so they do nothing to help balance the flavors. I normally love salty sweet combinations, but this missed the mark."
1_bj,2020-08-28,5,All the best flavors in one,"The peanut butter, the brownies and the pretzels all together!! So good, perfect amount of sweet and salty. I need more!!!!!"
1_bj,2020-08-13,5,Delicious!,"This flavor was AMAZING. I would not change anything about it! I never thought I would find anything better than Half Baked and Tonight Dough, but this flavor definitely made it up there with them."
1_bj,2020-07-03,2,Underwheming,I was really disappointed in this one. Flavors were blah. The peanut butter icecream tasted more like vanilla and hardly any pretzel flavor. Chubby Hubby is a much better choice with similar concept
1_bj,2020-04-21,3,Unique treat,"Salty and sweet, but could use more brownie chunks and pretzel swirls to achieve sheer perfection! The concept is there but my pint had paltry mix-ins."
1_bj,2020-03-06,5,The taste of happiness,"Honestly the best ice cream I have ever had. I was expecting good, but this is a game changer. B&J ya'll never let me down!"
1_bj,2020-03-31,5,Reminds me of my fave Candy Bar Pie!,I've be consistently buying this wherever I can! Please don't get rid of this!
1_bj,2020-05-17,5,I love this,Please don’t take this away from me. It is the perfect ice cream.
1_bj,2020-01-19,5,Great taste and worth every penny,Best Ice Cream ever been buying and loving Ben & Jerry's Ice cream since 2013 thanks keep up the good work
1_bj,2020-05-14,5,Best flavor ever ( please make permanent ),"The first time I tried this I was in love, it's the perfect peanut butter flavor with the perfect amount of sweet and salty, it's amazing & the chocolate brownies add just the right amount of chocolate. I've bought probably 16 pints so far, maybe more. I'm in love!! I look forward to my treat at night and I dont know what I'd do without this flavor. Please please please #Ben&Jerry's dont ever take this one away, Netflix & chill'd needs to become a permanent option. I'll be so sad if y'all stop making this one."
1_bj,2020-02-23,4,Pretty good!,"Great pb flavor! Love the salty pretzel swirl! But the brownie pieces were too big and chewy, like a dog eating pb. I think I’d prefer it with a fudge swirl and larger pretzel pieces. Will try it again, maybe it will have smaller brownie chunks. Peanut Butter World is still my favorite."
1_bj,2020-09-11,5,New Favorite for Ice Cream Addict,"I bought a pint of this when it first came out and I ate the whole thing in one sitting. And another the next day. And another the next... this is my FAVORITE flavor, even better than any I've had from any specialty ice cream parlor. It's the epitome of sweet and salty. The pretzels are almost more like sprinkles of salt with a bit of texture, the fudge brownie is dark and rich enough to break up any monotony. I don't want this to ever go away (even if it's responsible for 90% of my quarentine weight gain) :P"
1_bj,2020-03-31,4,Needs more brownie,I got the chocolate fudge brownie and yes there is a great amount of brownie but I think the ice cream to brownie ratio should be more brownie less ice cream!
1_bj,2020-04-08,5,Bomb Bomb BOMB dot com,B&J did it again. The creamy smooth texture of the peanut ice cream contrasted with the swirl of salty pretzel goodness engaged with nice healthy chunks of brownies. Perfect combination of flavor and texture. Thank you B&J for making another wonderful creation. You guys rock!
1_bj,2020-05-31,5,Simply amazing,I finally got around to trying this flavor and I’m so glad that I did! I’ve been buying Ben & Jerry’s for the past 15+ years and this is one of the best flavors I’ve ever had. The flavor of the peanut butter ice cream itself is incredible. I’m thoroughly impressed.
1_bj,2020-03-29,3,Way too salty,"Honestly I think maybe I just got a bad one from the grocery store. The flavors were good but it was just SOOOO salty. I will probably try it again though, hopefully it was just a goofed pint"
1_bj,2020-06-23,1,"Too salty, not sweet","This was the worst ice cream I’ve ever had. Peanut butter flavor mixed with pretzel is way too salty. There is almost no brownie, and the brownie pieces have no flavor. This would have been better if it was chocolate ice cream or chocolate fudge mixed in."
1_bj,2020-06-17,4,Sweet N Salty,"Peanut flavor is exceptionally bold and delicious, however the saltiness is oddly mixed in, I’ve had bites of mild salty pretzel and really really salty bites. Could do a little better in that regard."
1_bj,2020-04-29,5,My Favorite flavour,I bought this 3 days ago and just bought a second tub! Its absolutely perfect. I love the salty swirls and the brownies are soft and delicious. Please keep this flavour!
1_bj,2020-06-09,1,Not good.,The peanut butter ice cream was chalky and salty. The brownies were made with a very bitter chocolate. The pretzels were in a mushy mass and did not look appetizing. This was probably the only B&J ice cream I have not liked.
1_bj,2020-06-22,1,"Not very good, sorry","I am a fan of peanut butter cup and cookie dough, and birthday cake. But I think this one is too much. A simple peanut butter flavor with brownies and why not bananas would have been enough. Why the ""pretzels""? It tasted like uncooked dough. at least put real pieces of mini crunchy pretzel. I'm even surprised netflix associated their name to this ice cream :("
1_bj,2020-06-10,5,Best Ice Cream Flavor!,"Just tried this flavor and it’s officially my favorite! Perfect balance of sweet, salty and savory. The little bits of fudge are also SOOOOOOO GOOD! Can’t get enough"
1_bj,2020-03-19,1,Soooo Salty. Yuck,"Not a fan of this flavor at all. Seemed to have the makings of an awesome icecream with all sweet and salty components, however, the pretzel swirls were so salty it made me gag. 0/10 would not recommend"
1_bj,2020-06-21,1,One of the worst tastes ever,"I really enjoy different ice cream flavors, but this is just disgusting."
1_bj,2020-04-24,3,"great flavor, gritty texture","Looked high and low for the new flavor and was excited to try (peanut butter is my favorite). The flavor of the peanut butter ice cream was not overpowering as I was concerned, but pleasant. I was disturbed by the texture of the ice cream. It felt gritty and the brownie batter swirl had a taste like chocolate, but was the consistency of taffy. Not my favorite flavor."
1_bj,2020-07-10,1,Not my favorite flavor :(,"I’m eating this now, and it’s getting harder and harder to eat. The pretzel swirls are strangely too salty and the brownie pieces are too mushy. The peanut butter ice cream is okay. The combination of everything together just doesn’t work for me. Maybe it needs some texture? Some crunch? I still love you, Ben & Jerry’s!! I’ll stick to Phish Food and Gimme S’more."
1_bj,2020-03-29,5,Great!,Amazing flavors and amazing taste. One of my top 3.
1_bj,2020-04-29,2,Salt Explosion,"If you, like a horse, enjoy licking salt... than this is the ice cream for you. I really wish that the brownie parts were bigger and more brownie like. Also the pretzel dough bites are more like bits of playdough when it comes to flavor, and the added saltiness. Good Idea on paper, not so much in taste."
1_bj,2020-06-24,1,Nope,"How did Netflix approve this flavour? It’s been in my freezer for days, which never happens :/"
1_bj,2020-04-11,5,Honestly,"I bought this for the first time a few months ago, and wow. I was floored. This icecream is the most perfect balance of flavours ive ever experienced in a BJ pint. It is salty and sweet, but not too sweet as I find many BJ flavors, and not too salty."
1_bj,2020-04-23,1,Anticlimactic,"I was excited to buy this flavor but was quickly disappointed. To me the brownies tasted of rye bread, the ice cream was gritty (not in a good way, either). There was flavor of pretzel but I saw no pieces. I will probably go back to Phish Food next time."
1_bj,2020-05-27,3,Great concept that needs some tweaking in the lab,"I wanted to love this flavor. What’s not to like? Peanut butter ice cream with pretzel swirls and brownie pieces—should be a hit. It is not. First, the peanut butter ice cream is WAY too salty. I agree some salt is needed to offset what could otherwise be a cloyingly sweet peanut butter flavor, but this kills any semblance of peanut butter flavor and is unnecessary given the pretzel swirls. Second, why pretzel swirls and not pieces or chunks? The swirls are weirdly soft and barely evoke the sense of eating a pretzel. Finally, the brownie chunks were just weird. They are the same ones as in Half Baked, where they work beautifully. Here, I respect the need to bring in a chocolate component with a peanut butter base, that’s a no-brainer. But why not go with fudge chunks or chips? The brownies brought no flavor to this pint and certainly did not help on texture. A slight re-tooling of the flavors and components would probably make this the ice cream dream the description promised."
1_bj,2020-03-29,1,To much salt nasty,Tried it for the 1st time wont ever buy agian way to salty.
1_bj,2020-05-12,2,A true review,"This is probably one of the worst Ben and Jerry ice cream I’ve ever had. I love Ben and Jerry I’ve cream, but this one is just plain bad."
1_bj,2020-04-09,5,I am building a shrine to this flavor,"Okay, so when I saw this flavor first advertised I was out of my mind excited. I love peanut butter. I love brownies. And I love pretzels. But when I finally tracked it down in stores, I was disappointed because it wasn’t what I was expecting it to be. (Also, it melted a lot on the way home that day.)"
1_bj,2020-07-28,3,It's Okay...,"This flavor has such a fun name and sounded amazing, so I recently purchased it. It's not bad by any means, but I found myself wishing there was more sweetness and/or chocolate throughout it. I found the peanut butter and pretzel combo made it a bit on the saltier side, and it would have been nice to have some additional sweetness (like a caramel swirl or chocolate ice cream mixed in) to balance it out a bit more."
1_bj,2020-07-21,3,Missing the mark.,I love the peanut butter ice cream base. Very delicious and unexpected.
1_bj,2020-06-10,1,Worst flavor I’ve had,Probably the worst B&J’s flavor I’ve ever tried. What a waste of calories
1_bj,2020-06-19,5,This ice cream is the chip!,"Bought this as soon as I saw it in store last week. If you don't like sweet and salty stuff, this is not for you. As other reviewers said: I enjoy the milk chocolate, lighter, ice cream with chocolate chunks. The ""chips"" come in little balls and are surprisingly cripsy and chip tasting. I hope they add these as a permanent flavor! The people who don't like it probably also don't like pineapple on pizza .."
1_bj,2020-05-15,2,Intense,"The peanut butter flavor was overwhelming to me and the salty pretzel swirl just layered on the intensity. However, i feel if there were more brownies throughout it would balance out. They all seemed to be clumped into the bottom of mine."
1_bj,2020-06-11,5,Great Combination and Interesting Textures,"This has been my go-to flavor for the past month. The flavors go together really well, finding a perfect balance between the peanut butter, the pretzels and the fudge brownies. Another great thing about this flavor is the texture that it has which is pretty unique. Every bite you'll find a juxtaposition of the grainy pretzels and soft fudge swirls,. A truly delightful experience for the tastebuds!"
1_bj,2020-06-11,5,Netflix and Chill’d is my new favorite flavor,"It’s so good. The brownies are legitimately delicious as brownies, not brown blobs like other brands. The peanut butter ice cream and pretzel streak compliment each other. So good. I might give in and have it for breakfast today..."
1_bj,2020-03-07,4,Great PB Flavor!,Everything about this ice cream is amazing...except the brownies. They remind me of the cheap cosmic brownies you can get at the grocery store. The pretzel swirls are so tasty with them PB ice cream though!
1_bj,2020-07-07,1,High Expectations Not Meet,"Hard to go wrong with ice cream, peanut butter, pretzel and cookies. Somehow this does!"
1_bj,2020-05-13,5,May be my new favourite,This... is so good! I think its a perfect combo of salty and sweet; Didn't think I was too much of a peanut butter fan but this tastes so good honestly. I think it might beat Baked Alaska as my new favourite! PLS PLS PLS don't get rid of this flavour I know it's probably a limited edition or something but just rename it to something else without the Netflix.
1_bj,2020-08-04,1,Too salty,I am a life long fan of Ben & Jerry's and love most so flavors. This is the only one that I could not eat. I had to throw it out. The main problem was that it was way too salty.
1_bj,2020-05-14,5,"Love it! However, weird question...",The flavors and textures work beautifully together. This is an extremely satisfying ice cream for my palette.
1_bj,2020-05-26,1,What the heck were they thinking!?,"This is a terrible ""ice cream"" - I opened the pint, ate the bit stuck to the top of the lid and gagged so hard. How do you make peanut butter ice cream tasted like crushed hopes and dreams!? I'm so irrationally angry at this pint of ice cream I may never buy B&J's again... The only flavor I ever loved anyway was the creme brulee..."
1_bj,2020-09-21,2,Meh...,"I do KETO and this was my treat for my carb load day and I have to agree with another review that the pretzel pieces reminded me of eating sand...or KETO almond flour. Lol Alzo the brownie portion was sticky so it kept sticking to my teeth in am awkward way. Def not my fav flavor, sorry."
1_bj,2020-07-15,1,WAY too salty!!,I only had one piece of fudge and no pretzel bits! It was just pretzel crumbs & salt chunks in the middle. Sooooo dissappointed. :(
1_bj,2020-08-18,1,Flavor= Salt,Salt poured onto gross flavorless ice cream ... seriously not much else to say. Waste of money. Please go with other flavors.
1_bj,2020-08-22,5,New Favorite B&J Flavor!,"Can we take a moment to appreciate the delicious pretzel swirl in this, I need that in all my ice cream now! Such a great combination of flavors, the peanut butter ice cream is spot on and how Ben and Jerry's keeps their brownies so soft and fudgy is a miracle in itself. Love this flavor, so happy it looks like it will be a permanent flavor to the line!"
1_bj,2020-05-17,2,too much salt,"About every few bites, there is a clump of salt that tastes disgusting and feel likes you're biting sand."
1_bj,2020-02-05,5,Hooked,"I think I have a new favorite flavor. If they continue to make this flavor, I'm sure to get more!"
1_bj,2020-06-20,5,BEST ICE CREAM I HAVE EVER HAD,"I am writing this while eating my favorite ice-cream ever ! Honestly, i've discovered it during quarantine because i could not find my flavor at the grocery store. Sweet and yet salty; mix of texture really i am obessed and you should definitely trying ! This is my first time writing a review for something but really it is so wooooorthy !"
1_bj,2020-06-13,4,"Very tasty, however...","I LOVE anything with peanut butter and pretzels, and this point delivers that in an excellent way. I don't care for the brownien pieces, however. They're too big and don't taste very good. I think small pieces of chocolate fudge would work a lot better. This will not stop me from buying more of this flavor, though, that is for sure!"
1_bj,2020-09-20,1,Tastes like salty nutty sand,"I don't know if it was just my pint, but the chunks of pretzels were so small it was like eating sand that stuck to my teeth. I got this pint because I couldn't find my original pint Justice remixed anywhere, and I really regret it."
1_bj,2020-04-27,3,Meh,Was so excited about thia flavor. The peanut butter ice cream and pretzel swirl is bomb but my pint had 0 brownies!!! They need to rethink the final product. Its lack lust.
1_bj,2020-06-19,5,It’s not salty bro!,"I’m not a big peanut butter and chocolate fan BUT The peanut butter is so subtle in this icecream and with the pretzels it creates a dream and balances out the brownies. It’s amazing, I thought the tonight dough is my favourite but this is giving it a run for its money in my favourites"
1_bj,2020-06-11,4,Wonderful peanut butter flavor,I bought this to complement some chocolate cake. The peanut butter flavor is fabulous. The salt from the pretzel enhances the flavor. I'm on the fence about the brownie because I found it a bit gooey. Brownies are a good idea but maybe make them smaller and more chewy.
1_bj,2020-09-01,5,Great Taste!,"I've seen a few people complain about the saltiness. Pretzels are salty and it might not be the flavor for you. However, to those of us who love pretzels, peanut butter, and brownies: This is a GREAT flavor for those of us who like the sweet and salty mix of flavors!"
1_bj,2020-08-05,4,Awesome flavors,"I loved the flavors of this (one of my favorites so far) ... my only suggestion ... (I understand that it says a pretzel swirl) but some extra chunks of pretzel pieces would be nice... unless I just got a
dud... but still loved and can’t wait to purchase again."
1_bj,2020-02-29,5,Netflix n chilled,"THIS IS THE BEST FLAVOR EVER!!!! this flavor has been available for less than a week and my roommates and I have already bought 5 (yes you heard that right, 5!) pints!! The perfect blend of flavors. I hope this is a flavor for as long as I live! By far the best!"
1_bj,2020-05-19,5,Gave my husband a sweet tooth.,"Delicious sweet-salty flavour is our household favourite. My husband doesn’t usually eat dessert and the first tub we bought, I had a single, humble scoop, only to find out the next evening that he had finished the pot. I wish I had a bigger freezer."
1_bj,2020-08-31,4,I've Bought it Three Times,"Peanut butter and then the juxtaposition of the salt in the pretzels. So...read the review title and that's pretty much all. I watch movies with it, usually documentaries, dark comedies, or something uber tacky and sentimental like ""Dumb and Dumber."""
1_bj,2020-08-10,5,Simply amazzzin,"This ice cream is the perfect balance of different flavors all in one! I just can not get enough. Just when I think I have had enough I gotta keep going back to get more of that flavor explosion! Great job, please please don’t ever stop making it!!"
1_bj,2020-06-08,5,Best flavor of all time,If they get rid of this flavor I’ll literally sob! It’s the best one they’ve ever made! I’m not an ice cream person but bought one out of sheer curiosity and I can’t stop. It’s perfectly salty and sweet! Hands down the best ice cream I’ve ever had!
1_bj,2020-05-07,4,Golden ratio ice cream,"The peanut butter ice cream is deliciously rich and creamy. The brownie swirls are gooey and proportional with every bite, which pairs so well with the ice cream. The pretzels add an awesome touch to a balanced sweetness, salty and not too crunchy."
1_bj,2020-07-03,5,So creamy and great flavours!,"Absolutely love it, the peanut butter ice cream is amazing- such great flavour and texture and the rich brownie just cuts through the thick peanut butter taste SO WELL. Absolutely love this flavour, they have again delivered a master piece"
1_bj,2020-08-05,3,Interesting blend of flavors,The Peanut Butter flavor is very good although the fudge seems out of place and rubbery. The salted pretzel is a nice compliment to the PB but the overall blend of flavors reminds me of a PB&J sandwich. OK but not amazing.
1_bj,2020-06-11,5,MY MOST FAVORITE ICE CREAM IN THE WORLD,I love this ice cream and the pretzel swirl is my favorite thing. I've been waiting for B&Js to come back with this flavor. I like how salty it is. I've bought many to make sure I am stocked up. Please keep this flavor!
1_bj,2020-06-07,5,It’s just Amazing,This ice cream is so delicious. As soon as I tasted it I knew it would be a regular in my ice cream rotation. It’s the perfect mixture of salty and sweet and the flavors are just balanced really well. Highly recommend.
1_bj,2020-08-25,4,SO good,Sunday cheat night arrived and I already knew exactly what I was gonna do with it. This ice cream is delicious - the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I wish it had more pretzels/saltiness.
1_bj,2020-08-07,2,Where’s the Brownie?!?!,"Love the peanut butter flavour and the sweet and salty preztel swirls. Great for peanut butter lovers! However, I was disappointed that my pint did not have a single brownie bit, as mentioned in the description."
1_bj,2020-05-27,5,Best flavor of all time,I truly haven’t ever had an ice cream I like as much as this one. It’s creamy and has hunks of fudgey brownie with the salty peanut butter and pretzel pieces. I’m obsessed and I request a lifetime supply.
1_bj,2020-04-02,5,Great for PB lovers,"I got a pint a few weeks ago and was blown away. For the first time, I found an ice cream with a decent peanut butter flavor. The salty pretzel swirl adds a nice little flavor boost. I need more!"
1_bj,2020-08-23,5,This stuff is bomb!,"I didn’t think I would even like peanut butter ice cream and now this is one of my all time favorites!! I love the bit of saltiness and the brownie chunks are so soft. Oh man, it’s so dang gooooood."
1_bj,2020-09-13,5,BEST ICE CREAM EVER,This is the best ice cream I have ever tasted. It is the perfect blend of salty and sweet. Please please please Misters Ben and Jerry make it a full-time product instead of a limited flavor.
1_bj,2020-04-09,5,NUMBER ONE,This ice cream is heavenly. I have never written a review for ice cream before but this particular flavor was LIFE ALTERING..PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE send more up to the Central Maine area.
1_bj,2020-08-14,3,A bit too salty and not enough brownies,I would’ve loved more brownies and crunch pretzels. I liked the swirls but it was a bit salty. I’d choose chubby hubby over this one. I did enjoy the peanut butter ice cream.
1_bj,2020-06-06,5,Wow just wow - pretzels where u at,Delicious. Tastes like a peanut butter party on my tongue. Lots of brownie came through but the pretzels didn’t get the memo. Hopefully they come round in the next bowl
1_bj,2020-09-18,5,My new favorite flavor,I looked EVERYWHERE for this and it was totally worth it!! So so so good. Keep your eyes peeling in the freezer sections and don’t miss out!!
1_bj,2020-05-29,5,Great new flavor!,I love it. Please keep it around! I've tried both the vegan variety and the regular. Both delicious. That salty pretzel swirl. Wow. I also love the peanut butter base.
1_bj,2020-08-23,5,My Favorite... made me an ice cream person,I’m not one to choose ice cream over other sweets but this has changed that. By far the best flavor. I’ve bought a pint every week for the last 4 weeks. Delicious!
1_bj,2020-09-05,5,It’s my new favourite flavour.,I absolutely love the taste the combination between sweet and salty is perfect it’s sooooo good I literally finished the whole ice cream by myself in one day
1_bj,2020-05-27,5,Baddiebx,My girl on TikTok names baddiebx recommended this flavour to me and my friends so we all brought it and it’s amazing I’m so greatful she told me about it
1_bj,2020-06-25,5,What Dreams Are Made Of,My husband picked this up for me to make up for eating all of the Glampfire Trail Mix. And I'm so glad he did! Favorite flavor to date! Thank you! :)
1_bj,2020-08-01,5,DELICIOUS!,"Delicious combination peanut butter, gooey brownie, and salty pretzel. Love the texture and balance of flavors, please make this a permanent flavor!"
1_bj,2020-07-20,5,Please never stop making this flavor!,This is my favorite ice cream. We've been buying this regularly. The mix of salty and sweet is perfect. Please always make this flavor!
1_bj,2020-08-02,5,New favorite!,"I'm in loooove, the peanut butter ice cream isn't too sweet like many others are, and the salty pretzel swirl is *chef's kiss* perfect."
1_bj,2020-06-23,5,OH YEAH!,Bought this because I'm trying to try all the Ben and Jerry's flavors and was really happy with how great it is! Would buy again!
1_bj,2020-08-29,2,So much salt,Some bites are magical and some are HORRIBLE. I ended up tossing this day 2 because it was way too salty. Super disappointed.
1_bj,2020-07-24,5,Best ice cream ever,Not usually an ice cream person but this flavour is absolutely amazing and I can’t get enough of it!Very bad for my diet!
1_bj,2020-06-06,5,MY NEW FAVORITE,"I was skeptical at first but this is my new favorite ice cream! Found it in Durham, NC - haven't yet found it home in AL."
1_bj,2020-07-28,5,Favorite!,I think this is my favorite! My bus and and I hide them in the freezer from each other because we don’t want to share.
1_bj,2020-06-02,5,Amazing!,"This Ice Cream is the best! It is salty, it is sweet! The taste is heavenly please do not stop making this flavour!"
1_bj,2020-06-13,5,My favorite flavor,The salty pretzel swirl sets this flavor apart. It's dangerous for me to keep this in my house--I just can't stop.
1_bj,2020-06-10,5,PB ice cream- what could be wrong?,"If you love peanut butter, you’ll love this. There is more fudge than pretzel- or at least there was in mine."
1_bj,2020-08-03,5,the BEST,"Absolutely perfect combination!!! Creamy, peanut buttery, and slightly salty from the pretzels. Perfection"
1_bj,2020-06-11,4,Great Flavors except the brownie,I like the peanut butter ice cream and the salty pretzel (my wife didn’t) but I’m not a fan of the brownie
1_bj,2020-09-02,5,Fantastic!,"My favorite Ben & Jerry’s flavor and one of my favorite ice creams ever. Salty pretzels, chewy brownies."
1_bj,2020-04-22,5,Amazing,This is by far my favorite! I keep my freezer stocked when I can find them!! This flavor is a keeper!
1_bj,2020-08-05,5,Best DoorDash purchase!,"Soooo delicious! Spoonfuls of happy in this paininthebackside pandemic! Well done, Ben & Jerry's!"
1_bj,2020-06-02,5,Best ever,"I loved the amazing combination of flavors from this ice cream!
I found my favorite Ice Cream!"
1_bj,2020-06-06,5,Best ice cream ever,This ice cream is literally my favorite thing in the whole world. It's perfect in every way
1_bj,2020-09-14,5,Best Ice Cream Ever,I LOVE this flavor. I bought one pint and have since bought 25 pints in (2 or 3 months).
1_bj,2020-06-20,5,Amazing taste!!!,Bought this yesterday and ate it outside on the porch. Best ice cream i’ve had in a while!
1_bj,2020-08-24,3,More fudge brownie,"I bought this a few weeks ago, it needs more fudge brownie. Will go back to phish food."
1_bj,2020-08-08,5,Best ice cream flavor I’ve ever had,"I eat ice cream nightly, this one beats every other flavor. Please never stop making it"
1_bj,2020-06-01,5,Please keep this forever. I love it,Oh my lord. Best I’ve cream I have ever had!!! I go out of my way to find this.
1_bj,2020-05-19,5,MORE THAN LOVED,"this is by far my favorite flavor, i'm going tomorrow to get about 4 more lol"
1_bj,2020-05-10,5,Nirvana,This is the best ice cream I've ever had. Please never stop production.
1_bj,2020-06-07,5,And the Nominee for best ice cream flavor!,I am a Ben &Jerry's fanatic. Netflix and Chilled is soooooo bomb.
1_bj,2020-05-22,5,Two Big Thumbs Up!,This flavor better not go away. I mean like EVER!!! So tasty!
1_bj,2020-08-19,5,Dreamy,Bought this ice cream three times now and I’m obsessed. 10/10
1_bj,2020-06-28,3,Great flavor,The brownie pieces are awful but everything else is great
1_bj,2020-06-30,5,The Best Flavor,This is by far the best B&J flavor ever. I devoured it.
1_bj,2020-08-01,4,Its a nice flavour but..,I didnt saw any pieces of pretzel when i was eating It.
1_bj,2020-08-22,5,Couldn't be more delicious!,Wait... Maybe with some white chocolate pieces????
2_bj,2020-05-13,5,BEST flavor EVER,"During quarantine I was living off of Half Baked...but when I went to the store all that was left was Chip Happens. Having been heartbroken by another brand's ""Milkshake and Fries"" I reluctantly bought Chip Happens. I am happy to report Ben & Jerry's NAILED this flavor. The lighter chocolate, chocolate chunks and the perfectly CRUNCHY salty potato chip swirl is EXACTLY what every sweet/salty craving is made of. I put on my quarantine mask and went back to the store and bought the 4 pints left. I need another freezer to stock this flavor. Hope it remains a regular flavor because it says ""limited botched edition"". Break quarantine and RUN to get Chip Happens!"
2_bj,2020-07-12,5,"Please, never get rid of this potato chip flavor!",My favorite flavor used to be Late Night Snack because of the amazing innovation of the salty potato chip balls they used in combination with the sweet ice cream. The combo is heavenly. I've been waiting for years for Ben and Jerry's to bring back the potato chip ingredient and lo and behold yesterday at the store I found this flavor. It's even better than I remember late night snack being; the potato chip swirl provides a perfect salty and sweet combo in almost every bite. Please make this a permanent flavor; or at least release something else that uses this potato chip ingredient because I'll be SO sad if I have to wait years for it to appear again.
2_bj,2020-07-22,5,Perfect Combo!,"Please keep this as a permanent flavor as I've introduced this to others and we all LOVE it! Just like as a kid putting chips in my peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, this ice cream is the best thing since then! Love the chocolate ice cream with the chips!! Would love if you kept it around!!! Was bummed when I saw it was a 'limited botch'
Thank you!!!"
2_bj,2020-07-26,4,Love this flavor combo!,"I tried this for the first time a few days ago and the pint is already gone. This is a perfect flavor for someone that likes the sweet and salty combo (e.g. chocolate covered pretzels). The chip pieces add a nice twist to the chocolate, and the texture/consistency is not weird. There are some bites that I feel the chip chunks are a little too big,but overall it is great!"
2_bj,2020-07-21,5,Best B&J's flavor!,"I am a lover of all things sweet and salty, so when I saw this in my grocery freezer I just knew I had to try it. Ben & Jerry's did NOT disappoint with this flavor! I've searched for and bought this flavor countless times since I first found it a few months back, and I enjoy it a little more each time. The sweet & salty balance in this one is perfect. The only downside I can say is that the consistency of the potato chips are often in botches and not evenly distributed throughout, but that's nothing some scoop controlling can't fix. Please keep this one permanently!"
2_bj,2020-07-19,5,Amazing!,"I was so excited when I saw this flavor! I am usually picky with different ice cream flavors. Ben and Jerry’s used to have a flavor that was called The Kitchen Sink...I believe, which was vanilla ice cream with chunks of potato chips mixed in! It was my absolute favorite! I was so upset when it was discontinued! When I found this ice cream I was SO EXCITED! I’m hoping this will become a permanent flavor!"
2_bj,2020-07-19,5,Should be a permanent flavor,"This achieved what Late Night Snack could not--it is a FANTASTIC flavor. The chip swirls have the perfect salt content and potato taste. They stay crispy, which is a great complement to the thin crunch of the chocolate chips and that smooth, almost milk chocolate ice cream. THIS SHOULD BE A PERMANENT FLAVOR. IT'S SO GOOD."
2_bj,2020-05-01,4,Chip Chip Hooray!,"Fresh off the taste test, I'd say this was a great addition to the flavor line-up! It's simple but different enough from the usual B&J's components (although those are great too!). I appreciate that the base is a bit of a lighter, milkier chocolate-- more like in Chocolate Shake It than Fudge Brownie. The potato chip swirl is fantastically crunchy and salty. I'd love a real mish-mosh with a split between chocolate and vanilla (or peanut butter), and BOTH the chip and pretzel swirl (like in Glampfire Trail Mix)... what botch heaven that would be."
2_bj,2020-07-30,5,Blissful Contrast,"I am not usually the type that likes a lot of mix-in’s in my ice cream, in fact, it would be accurate to call me a plain Jane. However, I just recently happened to go on to your website and saw that this was a new flavor so after a trip to the grocery store......my palette my most pleased. It was such a wonderful combination both with the velvety chocolate ice cream and then the salty crunch of the potato chips!! Well done———-you most definitely nailed it!!!!!"
2_bj,2020-07-24,1,Can NEVER compare to Late Night Snack,"I have no idea why this has so many good reviews. This is a HORRIBLE flavor!! Bring back Late Night Snack before you bring back this GARBAGE. Late Night Snack was the PERFECT balance of salty and sweet. The chocolate covered potato chip balls and caramel were so so good!!
I love chips, but these are WAY too salty. The chocolate ice cream was a horrible choice, vanilla would have been better.
I have no idea how this even got made or why people like it. I am so so disappointed in you Ben and Jerry's. DO BETTER!!!"
2_bj,2020-05-13,3,Bring back Late Night Snack!,"Can I express how excited I was to see this on the shelves? I was beyond excited since I was a HUGE fan of Late Night Snack. Upon opening the lid, I noticed chocolate ice cream with giant chunks of chocolate chips and potato chips.On my first bite, I tasted molasses and then bits of chocolates and potato chips. I wasn't a fan of the strong taste of molasses.. Perhaps I was expecting something similar to the discontinued Late Night Snack. Chips Happen wasn't bad but it wasn't great."
2_bj,2020-08-08,5,Please keep this as a permanent flavor!!,"Simple and delicious flavors with great texture! The potato chip stays crispy, and it works great with the size of the chocolate chips. If I were to change anything, I’d add some more potato chip swirls. Maybe even keep the potato chip swirls but then include chocolate covered potato chips instead of the chocolate chips? I really hope this isn’t a fleeting “limited botch”"
2_bj,2020-04-19,5,For all the people who dip their fries in a frosty,"Absolutely delicious. Sweet, salty, creamy and crunchy. This is a pint of oxymorons and I love it."
2_bj,2020-07-30,5,PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE KEEP THIS FLAVOR!!!!!!,I’m obsessed with this flavor since I tried it. I can not believe how amazing it is. And the potato chips have the perfect crisp (don’t understand how) but it’s delicious. Please please please keep this flavor :(
2_bj,2020-08-03,5,This is literally perfect.,When i saw this i thought it would be gross because chips and ice cream seems just gross together but when my sister convinced me to try it i felt fireworks. the chips are perfectly salty and the chocolate isn't to chocolaty! Its perfect for people who eat dip their french fries in chocolate ice cream and its a fun and unique flavor to try out! would highly recommend!! :D
2_bj,2020-07-23,5,Make Chip Happens Permanent!,"When I first came upon this early June I tried the pint and within 5 minutes it was gone. The rich, velvety milk chocolate ice cream blends well with the contrasting textures of chocolate chunks and salty potato chips. I find a reason to drive 10 minutes 3 times a week just to stock up on this flavor exclusively. I am willing to lead the charge to make this flavor permanent. It's genius! I was disappointed that imy local store had sold out. I hope you consider this as a Fan Favorite!"
2_bj,2020-07-06,5,My New Number 1,"In the beginning my favorite was Coffee Toffee Bar crunch. Rich coffee, with satisfyingly semi-salted toffee. Salty-sweet taste combo stage-one unlocked."
2_bj,2020-05-03,5,Love the chips!,"Whilst I still hold a candle for 'Chubby Hubby' and my all-time fave here in Australia...'Clusterfluff' (was soooo good!), I must say that Ben & Jrry's nailed it (!) for sure with this new netflix inspired flavour. Far superior to their earlier 'Netflix and Chilled' option I certainly hope this 'limited botch' ice-cream becomesa mainstay as it is delicious and perhaps the best ice-cream that B&J has in Australia atm!"
2_bj,2020-05-07,2,Had such potential,"I was so excited to find this special pint - unfortunately, mine barely had the potato chip swirl I was looking forward to! Ben and Jerry’s are known for their ample mix ins, and this didn’t make the cut. Really bummed!"
2_bj,2020-07-25,5,Amazing sweet and salty,I’m a sucker for chocolate covered potato chips. This ice cream is my major weakness. The chocolate ice cream is the best (and I don’t care for chocolate ice cream). I hope this flavor stays.
2_bj,2020-07-31,5,Should be a permanent flavor!,"You guys nailed this one! It is perfection, the sweetness of the ice cream with a hint of saltiness of chips. I’d buy it every time I went shopping if it was a permanent flavor!"
2_bj,2020-06-26,1,Don’t want to ever eat this again,I’ve had ice cream with chips before and enjoyed it so was excited for this one. But this flavor is truly terrible. My boyfriend and i each ate a scoop & decided to throw the rest away - a choice we’ve never made before.
2_bj,2020-06-06,5,Very Good!,"I bought this in substitute of Americone Dream and I have got to say, I love this ice cream!! It tastes so good!"
2_bj,2020-06-06,5,Wonderful creation that makes the day better!,"I didn't buy it when I first saw this flavor at the store because potato chips aren't the usual ingredient in ice cream. But then I was convinced by my sister to try it, whether I like it or not, at least I will actually know how I feel. And oh boy, was I delighted!!! It's truly beautiful creation..!!! It tasted like eating potato chips and drinking chocolate shake at the same time (it doesn't sound weird anymore.) The potato chip swirls are, in fact, CRUNCHY, and salty! So yummy! I am happy that I decided to give this flavor a chance."
2_bj,2020-09-23,1,Good idea bad in reality,"Potato chips are dark tasting, like the crunchy burnt ends in kettle chips. First time I’ve gotten a flavor that I just couldn’t finish."
2_bj,2020-06-11,2,"Too Strange, Two Stars","Regular flavor made worse with potato chips. The combination of potato chips with chocolate ice cream is too strange for me. If you can't tell, I don't dip my fries in my milkshakes."
2_bj,2020-07-21,5,Make it permanent please!!!!,"Perfect chocolate ice cream! I love the lighter, less intense chocolate ice cream that’s similar to one of my other faves (chocolate milk and cookies). It really tastes more like chocolate milk. The potato chip swirls are a perfect salty complement to the mild sweet. Im a huge fan of chocolate covered chips so this is right up my wheel house. PLEASE make this a permanent flavor!!!"
2_bj,2020-08-17,5,Best ice cream!,After Trader Joe’s discontinued their chocolate covered potato’s chips I’ve been in search for something close. This nailed the same flavor and was so much better. Great mix of sweet and salty. It’s like in n out fries dipped in their chocolate milkshake. Turned my whole family onto this flavor and we bought out the two stores that carried it. Please Please continue the flavor!
2_bj,2020-06-12,1,A grainy aweful mess,"Ew, not good at all. The chip swirl is like chewing sand and it disrupts the rest of ice cream. This was not pleasant. Icky stuff. Wish I’d never tried it."
2_bj,2020-07-18,5,Please make this permanent!,"I’ve never felt moved to write an ice cream review before - a friend recommended this flavor, which has been hard to find so when I came across a pint buried in the freezer at a store I don’t usually go to, I was excited to try it. Honestly this is one of the best combos I’ve ever had and I’m not usually a big fan of chocolate ice cream. The potato chips are insanely good and the mix is perfect for salty/sweet lovers like me. PLEASE consider expanding this beyond a “limited botch”!"
2_bj,2020-09-06,5,Make it a KEEPER!!!,"I remember when A flavor called “Late Night Snack” was released a few years back and it was the first and only ice cream I’d ever tried with potato chips in it. I was put off by the idea of someone ruining ice cream with such an absurd idea but trust me people, potato chips and ice cream belong together!!!! I was bummed when Late Night Snack never appeared again but was ecstatic when this flavor released!!! Please don’t get rid of this flavor!!! My local store cannot keep it stocked because it is THAT good!!!!"
2_bj,2020-08-23,1,Nope,I love Ben&Jerry's but this flavor was a disaster. The chocolate doesn't mix with the saltiness of the chips and it just tastes so wrong.
2_bj,2020-07-26,5,Please make permanent!,this is my new favorite flavor. this chocolate base is better than any of their others and this potato chip swirl is incredible. i don't buy ben and jerry's that often because of the price point but i would for this pint! this is an incredible sweet and salty blend and i can't get enugh!
2_bj,2020-07-19,5,My absolute favorite: please keep permanently!,Oh my goodness—this combination of salty and sweet is everything I need in life. I could never have another flavor of ice cream in my life and be just fine.
2_bj,2020-06-27,5,Please make it permanent!!!,"I do not write reviews very often at all, but I really wish this was a permanent flavor and I am hoping if they get enough great reviews it will be. I was skeptical of course that it would just be soggy chips in a pile of icecream, but it is in fact crisp af. It is a must try flavor I wish I could find anywhere, but unfortunately I have to drive to one specific Target to get my hands on it. Thanks to Ben and Jerry's for all of their hands on support in the community."
2_bj,2020-05-23,5,LITERALLY THE BEST FLAVOR EVER,"My roommate brought this glorious flavor home for our late night binge and my life will never be the same. I have a huge sweet tooth so I have a lot of experience when it comes to ice cream. This flavor is the perfect mixture of sweet and chocolaty with a sprinkle of salty. It honestly reminds me of dipping a french fry in my Wendy's frosty, dare I say it. I am seriously in love, I can't find it in my local store anymore so really hoping it becomes a permanent flavor."
2_bj,2020-07-23,5,Delicious!,I got this a number of days ago and it’s absolutely delicious. The chip swirl makes sure you get it throughout the ice cream. I really hope this stays in the collection!!
2_bj,2020-07-23,5,Favorite of all time,"Half Baked has been my favorite ice cream, but this beat it. I wish the whole potato chip, sweet salty thing was more popular because this is amazing."
2_bj,2020-07-23,5,My all time time favorite,This ice cream is my newest addiction. I have been buying as much as I Can before it’s gone. I’m begging for this to become a permanent flavor.
2_bj,2020-08-04,5,Please make it permanent!!,Chip happens is my absolute new favorite ice cream! The chocolate and salty mix BEAUTIFULLY! Please keep it around!!
2_bj,2020-05-06,2,Too Salty,Wayyyy to salty I couldn’t even finish it. but I did enjoy the chocolate.
2_bj,2020-06-07,3,"Delicious Chocolate, Iffy Chips","Love trying new Ben and Jerry’s flavors, so I immediately grabs this when I saw it on the shelf. Overall it takes like dipping fries into a Wendy’s Frosty. The chocolate flavor is AMAZING! However, I wasn’t a big fan of the chip “swirls”. It’s soft and doughy, but salty like a chip. The texture threw me off, and reminded me of salt dough. I wasn’t able to enjoy it. If they made just the chocolate flavor separately I would definitely buy it! Tastes just like a frosty."
2_bj,2020-07-22,5,One of the few good things to happen in 2020,"What a great combination of flavors, I truly hope this will be around for awhile."
2_bj,2020-08-11,5,"If you get rid of this, I will cry.","This is the best ice cream flavor ever. I'm someone who gets fries and dips them in a chocolate shake, and this ice cream is like that but with less mess, more texture, and more flavor. I love the sweet and salty combo, and I feel that the addition of the chocolate chunks are really what make this ice cream so unbelievably fantastic. And the chips -- they're in a swirl, they stay crunchy, and there's the perfect amount! The combination of textures and flavors is just amazing.
My only complaint is that this is a limited botch. Like the title of this review says, there will be tears from me if you get rid of this. This NEEDS to be a regular flavor, and I really hope this opens up the door for more sweet and salty flavors. Please don't get rid of this flavor! If you do, I will hoard as many pints as possible and eat them for years."
2_bj,2020-07-02,5,if you ever dipped your french fries in a frosty..,"i’m always a fan of the sweet and salty combination, especially chocolate and salt. i also love chocolate covered potato chips, AND i’m a fan of the show so this was a no brainer. it’s rich, the flavors work really well together and it’s equitably distributed throughout. i can’t express how much i love this flavor, how many pints my partner and i go through, and how much i hope it stays in permanent rotation. NAILED IT!"
2_bj,2020-07-19,3,Make this flavor permanent!!!!!,Cherry Garcia used to be my favorite. I cannot get enough of Chip Happens. Please make this flavor a regular and not a limited addition. It will bring happiness across the world.
2_bj,2020-06-29,5,Perfect Combo of Sweet & Savory!,"Best new Ben & Jerry’s flavor since Tonight Dough! I almost ate an entire pint in one sitting, it was so good. It has all my favorite things in one ice cream! I certainly hope that you keep this flavor around, it’s too good to be a limited batch only."
2_bj,2020-07-06,5,Amazing chocolate CHIPs!,"I have always been a huge fan of chocolate covered potato chips, so when I saw Ben and Jerry’s had come out with a flavor including both of these flavors, I had to try it. I do not know how they did it, but getting the chips into the ice cream without the chips becoming soggy is a dream come true, and absolute magic as far as I’m concerned. I have found my favorite ever ice cream. Thank you!"
2_bj,2020-08-20,5,Perfect Mix of Sweet and Salty,"This flavor is freaking amazing! After falling in love with another limited batch flavor, I told myself I wouldn't try any others in case they disappear forever. Well when I saw Chip Happens at the grocery store I couldn't resist... and have bought a dozen pints since! The chocolate flavor is rich but somehow still light, the chocolate chunks add to the sweetness perfectly, and the chip crumbles are heavenly. 5 stars."
2_bj,2020-07-11,5,"I came here to write a review, didnt I?","This ice cream is my favorite. It’s salty and sweet at the perfect combination of happiness on a spoon. I want to stockpile it because I can’t imagine a world where I can’t grab this guilty please out of the fridge. It’s getting me through social distancing and COVID19 and the woes of the world. I beseech you, please make this a permanent addition. I’m begging. I’m pleading."
2_bj,2020-07-11,5,Nailed my all time favorite snack!!!,i love love love this flavor!!!! i was so upset when you got rid of the “late night snack” flavor a few years ago but this one is perfect!! please make it forever and ever ❤️
2_bj,2020-07-06,5,Please make this a permanent flavor!,"Real truth, I’ve never been a huge fan of Ben & Jerry’s. Most flavors sound amazing but they end up being a let down. This is an exception. The chocolate base is just right and the potato chip ribbons contrast the sweet with just enough salty. It’s perfection."
2_bj,2020-05-27,5,Unreal,"My girlfriend was moved to tears of joy after her first bite, it’s that good. How on earth are the chips still crunchy? Amazing"
2_bj,2020-09-22,5,Perfecto!,"Honestly it's my favorite ice cream of all time and I'm super stressed that I can't find it anywhere. I guess on the bright side, my wife and I are no longer fighting over who gets to eat it and our marriage counseling bills have lessened."
2_bj,2020-04-08,1,Bad flavuot,Taste dreadful. I don't know whos idea it was to make this flavour but they are
2_bj,2020-07-13,5,FAVE FLAVOR EVER!! PLEASE DO NOT DISCONTINUE!,"Please make this a permanent flavor. This is hands down my favorite flavor I have ever tried....I absolutely love it. The salty crispy potatoe chips...my gosh!! I love having this as a treat daily. Keeps me sane during shelter in place. Also, B&J is a kickass company that stands for social and racial justice. Love their ice cream and their values."
2_bj,2020-05-12,5,In love,Wow. This flavor is the best thing I’ve ever had! Absolutely amazing!!! Please keep it forever :)
2_bj,2020-07-18,2,Kinda average,So I literally just bought it and was excited but I dunno it’s kinda mediocre. Obviously B&J makes fantastic ice cream this one just ain’t doin it for me. The potato chips are chewy not crunchy and they taste kinda fake I found myself eating around the potato bits.
2_bj,2020-07-05,5,Should be a permanent flavor,"I was hesitant to try this, but it was on sale so I figured I’d got it a shot. Omg. I’m not usually a big sweet and salty person because I think it can make the sweet taste too sweet, but this ice cream balanced the flavors perfectly. Also the chips are somehow perfectly crisp and crunchy. Please make this a forever flavor!!"
2_bj,2020-06-08,5,Awesome,Best ice every. Must keep making this ice cream!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2_bj,2020-06-07,5,Amazing blend,"Amazing blend of smooth, then crunch, salty, and then sweet!!"
2_bj,2020-06-11,5,PLEASE KEEP THIS FOREVER,"I love it so much! The potato chip swirl is really good, idk who B&Js does it but it literally tastes like regular chips. The sweet and salty combo is bomb and the fishes chips are really good too. Please B&Js keep this flavor forever"
2_bj,2020-07-11,5,Potato Chip Swirl!!,"I had no idea potato chip swirl is what was missing from my life. I have told everyone I know about this flavor. It is incredible in its subtle way of mixing all the flavors and textures of smooth, decadent and crunchy, together. Sincerely, begging for this to not be just a limited release--it's too good to see it go away."
2_bj,2020-05-14,5,A Game Changer,"I am a 63-year-old mom, I have been eating Ben & Jerry’s for years. My ice cream of choice is Chubby Hubby, it’s been that for years but it just got knocked down to second place. This Chip Happens is the best ice cream flavor Ive ever had. Cannot get over how crunchy the potato chips are. How do they do that in ice cream and they’re not soggy. So unbelievably delicious."
2_bj,2020-04-28,5,My favorite,His is my absolute favorite flavor now! Please keep it
2_bj,2020-06-11,5,Please don’t take this away!!!,"This is the best Ben & Jerry’s flavor I’ve ever had! The mmmm it has just enough sweet, salty, and chocolate. My absolute favorite! Please do not discontinue this flavor! However, in case you do, I am going to stock up."
2_bj,2020-07-14,5,This is the best,This the the best Ben and Jerry’s ice cream I have ever had where I live we don’t have a Ben and Jerry’s shop so we have to get it from the store and no place has it be cause it is everybody’s favorite we always ask when the might get a shipment and hurry to get it from the store I wish they would carry it more!
2_bj,2020-06-07,5,Potato chips are AMAZING!!!,"Thank you so much for this flavor! I truly hope that it stays on the market. Ever since Late Night Snack got discontinued I've been hoping that you would introduce a new mix that included potato chips. It may sound like a strange ingredient to some, yet the salty sweet combo can't be beat! LOVE THIS FLAVOR!!!"
2_bj,2020-05-14,5,This chip is good!!!,"If you're a sweet and salty fanatic like me, get this.. It's amazing!! I've been spreading the word about how amazing this flavor is. If you're wondering if the chips are soggy.. They are NOT!! Idk how they managed to keep them so crispy, but they are, and it's so amazingly tasty. Sad it's a limited batch!"
2_bj,2020-06-06,5,Perfect sweet and salty combo,"Love Ben & Jerry's in general and this flavor did not disappoint. My curiosity was peaked by the description of the flavor and the ""limited botch"" label. It was delicious, reminds me of how I dip french fries in my milkshakes to get that sweet and salty balance. Hope this becomes a permanent flavor!"
2_bj,2020-06-15,5,OMG,This ice cream was so delicious that it made me write a review in the hopes it will not end up in the flavor graveyard like my beloved Vermonty python. The ice cream is packed with chocolate chips but the best part is the crunchy potato chip swirls. This is everything I need right now.
2_bj,2020-07-21,5,Delicious! Make it a regular part of the line up!,Such a great combo! Please make this a regular part of the ben and Jerry’s line up.
2_bj,2020-05-28,5,Sooo good!!!,This is the perfect combination of salty and sweet. I really hope this is a flavor that sticks around and becomes a permanent flavor. You won’t be disappointed!
2_bj,2020-08-24,5,"BEST, MOST UNIQUE ICE CREAM EVAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!","When my friend told me she'd found an amazing ice cream with POTATO CHIPS in it, I was like, ""Ewwww. Who came up with that nasty combo?."" But after I tried the flavor, I could NEVER go back. This is the BEST ice cream I have EVER eaten, and I pray God each night that it will not be limited edition. Thank you Ben & Jerry's!!! <3 Colin"
2_bj,2020-06-04,5,The best ice cream flavor,I was perusing the Ben and Jerry’s section when I found this beautifully delicious flavor. I was a little skeptical at first but as an Irishman I could not resist the delicious potato and I am glad I didn’t this is my new favorite. I hope it becomes a regular flavor.
2_bj,2020-06-19,5,PLEASE KEEP THIS PERMANENTLY!,"This is the best ice cream I have ever had. It is the perfect combination of salty and sweet. (Note, the chips are quite salty so if you're not into that it may not be for you) but holy cow it is for me. Please please please keep this as a permanent product."
2_bj,2020-09-14,5,Scrumptious.,I decided to go out on a limb and try this one day. I saw Ben & Jerry’s social platform and absolutely wanted to give this company my support. I was not disappointed. This ice cream is absolutely BOMB and Im so sad because it’s been sold out at my local grocery stores for a while. Please keep this flavor!!
2_bj,2020-07-07,5,A Snackers DREAM,"This is exactly what I want in a snack, sweet and salty. There’s the perfect amount of potato chips and chocolate chunks you can get some in every bite. It was absolutely delicious and I wish this would stay a permanent flavor!"
2_bj,2020-08-05,5,So yummy! The perfect sweet and salty treat!,"I love everything about this! It’s even better than Late Night Snack (but where is that one? Bring it back, too?). We need more sweet and salty flavors, and this one had plenty of the chip swirl, as well as the sweet chocolate ice cream. Love love love this. Please add it permanently!"
2_bj,2020-07-08,5,One of my fav flavors ever,I will be sad when I can't find this flavor anymore. It was my new favorite -- the chip swirl is delicious and the chocolate tastes almost malted. It's so good.
2_bj,2020-06-22,5,Salty sweet goodness!,"I just bought this flavor today and I can tell you if you are a salty and sweet fan like myself you will love this ice cream. I really hope they keep this as a permanent flavor, it's a perfect combination of flavors. Please keep this one around!"
2_bj,2020-07-06,5,AMAZING TASTE,"I cannot say enough about these incredible flavors, the saltiness of the chips are unbeatable. I would buy 1 million of these if I had space in my freezer."
2_bj,2020-08-09,5,"Best Flavor, Hands Down","This is the best Ben & Jerry’s flavor I’ve ever had, no cap. I made my boyfriend drive me to five different grocery stores until we found some & I (no joke) bought five pints. I DIE by Chip Happens. I would kill a man for this ice cream flavor."
2_bj,2020-06-30,5,amazing flavor - please make permanent!!!,i've been waiting for a flavor with potato chip mix ins since ben and jerry's got rid of jimmy fallon's late night snack! please keep this one around
2_bj,2020-06-07,5,Best thing since Late Night Snack,This is the absolute best flavor since Late Night Snack. I hope this becomes a permanent flavor. Late Might Snack will always hold a special place in my heart but if this is the flavor that stays then I’ll take it! Absolutely the best
2_bj,2020-06-22,5,Perfect combo of sweet and salty,This tastes amazing ! I love the milder chocolate flavor of the ice cream which is more like a milkshake flavor and the swirl of chips is the perfect combo of crunch and salt flavor. Please consider making this a permanent flavor!
2_bj,2020-09-11,5,I want this to be a part of my life forever,"This is the best ice cream flavor, hands down, I have ever tried. I will truly mourn its loss if it isn’t made permanent. I have literally gone searching for it at different stores and I scoop it up (heh) every time I see it."
2_bj,2020-09-11,5,Love this chip!,Please continue to make this flavor! The sweet of the chocolate and the salty of the potato chips is a match made in heaven. I bought the last pint at my local store today. Fingers crossed it will be available for reorder!
2_bj,2020-08-08,5,Make it a permanent flavor,"It was love at first pint. And now I'm on my third. This ice cream is the perfect balance of sweet and salty, smooth and crunchy. Please consider making this limited batch into a full time flavor. You have truly Nailed It."
2_bj,2020-07-01,5,So good oh my god,The potato chip crunch bits are just so good and salty and amazing. Probably my favorite flavor
2_bj,2020-08-31,5,Love the sweet and salty!!!!,"Please make this a permanent flavor!!! It saved my quarantine! Love the crunchy salty potato chip swirl, the milk chocolate ice cream, and the perfectly sized chocolate flakes... please bring it back!!!"
2_bj,2020-07-14,5,Delicious...sweet and salty yummy!,LOVE this flavor combo. The sweetness and salty balance is perfect. Please keep it-yummy!
2_bj,2020-08-01,5,Amazing!,Seriously insane. The salty crunchy chip swirl ice cream mixed with the chocolate is the perfect combo. I was skeptical but this might be my favorite new flavor in years. Please make permanent!
2_bj,2020-06-25,5,Amazing New Flavor,"I bought this flavor in the last couple of days and it is my new favorite! I used to love chocolate covered potato chips and can no longer find them, but this just beats that by so much more :D"
2_bj,2020-07-06,5,AMAZING!,I absolutely love this flavor! It's the perfect blend of sweet & salty
2_bj,2020-06-15,5,Oh my Goodness!,"Chunky monkey has been my all time but this is the best ! I love love love it! You guys nailed it, please don’t make this limited edition. It needs be a ever lasting flavor! Thank you!"
2_bj,2020-04-26,5,Absolutely Amazing,I bought this Saturday afternoon and I love this creation! Deliciously sweet!
2_bj,2020-05-29,5,Great combo,Luv the chocolate taste with the salty crunch of the chips. Great combo
2_bj,2020-05-18,5,Forbidden Levels of Pleasure,"This flavor is so good, it hurts. Nothing should have this level of salty crunch mixed with sweet enough vanilla and chocolate ice cream. This pint completely destroyed me."
2_bj,2020-06-19,5,SALTY AND SWEET,"Literally snack heaven. Sweet but not overly rich chocolate ice cream, chocolate chunks, and a thick ribbon of crunchy salty chip! So good. Please keep making this forever."
2_bj,2020-06-01,5,"Mostly sweet, but just enough salty","And chocolate. Need I say more?
Apparently so, to fill out the review."
2_bj,2020-06-09,5,Creamy creme,"Crunchy, choclatey goodness that certainly satisfied my craving for ice cream craving. The ice crame even has salt that thought would be terrible, but it was delicious!"
2_bj,2020-05-12,5,AMAZING,this flavor seemed weird to me at first but now its literally my favorite i usually buy 3-4 tubs just because the taste is soo good and u still get a crunch love it !
2_bj,2020-06-19,5,Sooo good!!,"These are three of some of my favorite flavors,I think it’s a great combination.If the product changes from limited batch,I would love to always buy this product!!"

2_bj,2020-05-27,5,Late Nite Snack is reborn!!,MY life has not been the same without that perfect little blend of sweet and salty. Thank the B&J gods for this true gift of the people.
2_bj,2020-06-03,5,Salty sweet goodness,Salty mix of crunchy chips and dairy queen cone dip flakes in a chocolate ice cream. So good! Don't want to buy any other flavors now
2_bj,2020-08-19,5,Heaven sent,Literally the best thing I’ve ever eaten in my life. I am so so so sad I didn’t know the last time I ate it would be the last time
2_bj,2020-05-17,5,Delicious,Ben and Jerry was on sale last week at a local grocery store....ended up going back for three more pints of this!
2_bj,2020-08-19,5,Looove,I love the sweet and salty combination! It is so good and addictive...definitely a go to after a stressful day!
2_bj,2020-06-08,5,This needs to be permanent,Bought today and have eaten almost half of it already. I loveee it. I need this to be a permanent flavor :)

2_bj,2020-06-21,5,Best flavor yet!,Flip me over and give me some of this goodness!!!!
2_bj,2020-08-24,5,MY FAVORITEST ICE CREAM EVAARRRRRRRR,"Dearest Ben and Jerry,
Chip Happens is the most divine ice cream flavor to ever grace this earth. Honestly, the way the potato chips looked on the packaging looked a little suspicious. BUT, I was BLOWN AWAY WHEN I TASTED THIS MASTERPIECE OF A FROZEN DESSERT. I LOVE IT SO MUCH. it is the PERFECT combination of sweet and salty. And just REALLY GOOD. In fact, I recommended it to a friend, who once said his favorite flavor was mint chip. BUT ONCE HE TASTED HE THE HEAVENLY TASTE OF CHIP HAPPENS, HE WAS converted as well. We ate so much ice cream for two weeks and put hot fudge on it. It was really a beautiful experience. I will forever hold these memories close to my heart. A month later, I returned to the grocery store scouring the shelves for my beloved ice cream. And to my horror, I could not find it. I even had a whole conversation with a lady at the grocery store employee about how distraught i was. I returned home, sad, hungry, and heartbroken, for my beloved ice cream had left. But, I will not rest until i can experience this ice cream flavor once more. I am calling on you Ben and Jerry, BRING BACK THIS ICE CREAM FLAVOR. IT IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN YOUR STANDARD FLAVORS AND DESERVES TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR THE BEAUTEOUS FOOD ITEM IT IS. I WISH FOR NOTHING MORE THAN TO TASTE THE SWEET GOODNESS OF CHIP HAPPENS.
Love,
Audrey"
3_bj,2020-08-12,5,OMG!!!!!! SOOOOOOO DELICIOUS!!!!!,Am trying this flavor for the first time right now. Took my first bite and fell in love IMMEDIATELY!! May just be my new favorite flavor!! Have tried a different brand of mascarpone ice cream before and it basically just tasted like vanilla. This is the complete opposite!! Definitely not just plain old boring vanilla!! Can NOT believe how amazingly delicious this is!! Everyone needs to try this now!! Would probably drive 10 hours to get this if i had to like omg it's just that good!!!!!!!!!! Please ben and jerry's-I'm literally begging you to keep this flavor FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3_bj,2020-08-18,5,LOVE THE SWIRL,"I love this flavor. It’s light but packs a POWERFUL flavor punch. And the swirl is kind of hidden by its color but man if you find a big pocket of it and try and isolate it, it’s the BEST. The chocolate covered pastry things have Always been crunchy in my 20+ pints to date. The flavor is just so boom in your face. The texture of the Mars alone swirl is insane. This is my 2nd favorite flavor behind Gimme Smore. So help me god if you guys discontinue this flavor or gimme smore, I will come down on you with the wrath of a thousand lightning bolts. Haha. Plz make a cake batter with chocolate chocolate chip swirl and a brownie batter something"
3_bj,2020-03-29,5,My Prayers Have Been Answered!!,"I was devastated when the “Holly Cannoli” flavor was discontinued years ago. Every time I passed the ice cream aisle in my supermarket, I’d search for the Cannoli flavor, hoping to see it again. Just when I was about to give up, THERE IT WAS!!!!! I scooped up every pint I could get my hands on. This flavor is the best!! The sweet marscapone cream and chocolatey shell pieces make for a sweet celebration for the tastebuds. Thank you so much for bringing this awesome flavor back! Please don’t ever discontinue it again. You’ve struck gold with this flavor — it is truly is a treat!"
3_bj,2020-06-14,5,I think this is my new 2nd favourite ice cream,"Oh man. Where to begin. Two bites and I knew. The marscapone ice cream? Dude. The cannoli shells? DUDE. They're so crispy it's almost like magic how crispy they stay. And coated in chocolate nonetheless! The marscapone swirl is something you almost forget about too but like not even in a bad way because you end up stumbling upon it without expecting to do so and it HITS YOU IN THE FACE WITH DECADENT FLAOUR. Also the chocolate chips are the mini's, the cute ones. Perfectly sized!! B & J knocked it out of the park with this one. A+++"
3_bj,2020-02-10,5,SO HAPPY IT IS BACK,Please keep this around forever! For over 7 years I have hoped that this day would come where my favorite dessert ever would return! Such a delicious ice cream!
3_bj,2020-04-06,4,Not half bad,"The icecream itself is luxuriously fatty, so it does take some time to eat this as compared to opposing flavors. The mascarpone swirls is what I'd say takes the cake for me, though be aware that not all the chocolate-covered cannoli pieces will be as crisp as you'd expect them to be."
3_bj,2020-02-17,5,I eat one a day,"This is so good, i have been eating one a day, please keep this around so i can keep eating it"
3_bj,2020-04-05,1,Absolutely Terrible!,I love cannoli's and couldn't wait to try this. Finally found it and was so excited. But it was a total let down. This taste nothing like any cannoli I ever had. Absolutely terrible.
3_bj,2020-02-10,5,Thank you for making my dreams come true!,"I have been craving, whining about, and reminiscing about this flavor for YEARS."
3_bj,2020-09-23,1,Cannoli? I don’t think so,"Not only does this ice cream do nothing to remind you of a cannoli it does not taste good at all. The container says A fan favorite.Overly sweet with an unpleasant aftertaste. Took two bites and tossed the rest. A total misfire. Clearly those fans have never tasted a real cannoli or one of B&J’s better flavors,"
3_bj,2020-08-25,5,Holy Cannoli!!!!,"Bought this on my recent trip to Target. Had NO expectations...it just sounded interesting. To my surprise this flavor has quickly become my new fave! (Right under Half Baked) It seemed creamier than usual which I attribute to the marscapone. The cannoli pieces are delish and it is an overall pleasant experience. No clue why anyone would call it ""plain"" unless they were expecting the ice cream to be the flavor of the shell or something. If you are looking for something packed with flavor this one isn't for you. This flavor is meant to have when youre craving a more sophisticated dessert. Quick tip: let it sit out until its soft enough that you're not waging war between it and your spoon at every bite. Takes it to another level ;)"
3_bj,2020-04-30,2,Where’s the shell pieces?!,"The flavor is great, but there were almost no pieces of the cannoli shell in the pint. My husband and I both thought it was strange, and maybe a bad batch because you can always count on the pints to be pretty full of all the good stuff listed in the description. But not this time. And I see from another review that maybe this isn’t a fluke after all. The cannoli shell is the best part of the dessert, so it shouldn’t be skimped."
3_bj,2020-02-26,5,Hopefully never discontinued again!,"A delicious take on the classic Italian dessert, B&J's Cannoli is a winner. The base is described as a marscapone flavor. Now marscapone isn't typically used for Cannolis but instead ricotta. Marscapone is a cream cheese used for cakes and other desserts. While not quite fitting the theme of a Cannoli in that regard, B&J made the right choice for the sake of flavor. The base is absolutely like a heightened cheesecake. Almost as if their regular cheesecake flavor was mixed with the equally delicious buttery brown sugar one. It's fantastic. The swirl is the same flavor, so they blend together seamlessly for a full on sweet cream cheese taste. And the pastry pieces are the perfect contrast to the base. Crunchy and covered in chocolate, they remind me of the similar chocolate dipped waffle cone pieces from Americone Dream, and there are plenty in each pint. Whether it fits the theme or not, Cannoli is a great flavor that I hope stays as a mainline one for a long time."
3_bj,2020-03-24,1,Bland and Disappointing,"Finally found this and regret it. It doesn’t taste at all like a cannoli, the bits were sparse and again, tasteless, like eating little chucks of chocolate covered cardboard. Waste of money and calories; just eat a cannoli."
3_bj,2020-08-21,1,"If you like cannolis, you won't like this","Do yourself a favor and put this ice cream down, walk over to the bakery section of whatever store you're in and get an actual cannoli. This tastes like someone added a crap ton of powdered sugar to artificially flavored cheesecake ice cream and blended it with stale cannoli bits (these could also be bran flakes for all I can tell but I'll take their word for it.)
So if you want a cannoli, get a cannoli and if you want Ben and Jerry's get a more reliable and well made flavor, they have so much better to offer than this."
3_bj,2020-05-07,2,Doesn't taste like a cannoli.,"First of all traditional cannoli are made with ricotta, not mascarpone. This tastes more like tiramisu without the coffee. It's missing the liquor flavor of a cannoli and was too cheesy. It would be better if it had chocolate shavings, but the base is wrong. I ate it, but I would not it buy again."
3_bj,2020-09-12,5,Makes my Italian knees shake with pleasure!,I happened to find this flavor when I went shopping today at Albertsons and I love all kinds of Italian cuisine. Cannolis are one of my favorite desserts. The flavor of this ice cream was delicious and tasted exactly like a cannoli! Perfect flavor!!
3_bj,2020-05-07,1,Not at all like a Cannoli,"I was so excited to try this because I love a good cannoli. The taste was just wrong. I really didn't like anything about this flavor. The ice cream itself was marscapone which isn't what's in a cannoli. This was just a fail, cannot recommend."
3_bj,2020-05-05,3,"Good, not impressed","The ice cream is light and fluffy, just as expected from Ben & Jerry’s, but I think the mascarpone ice cream is just a variant of vanilla ice cream. The crunch from the chocolate shells is rad and the mascarpone swirls are delicious."
3_bj,2020-05-02,4,Could’ve been perfect!,Bought this a few days ago after searching for a while. So looking forward to it. I loved the flavors BUT it should have had way more cannoli shell pieces. There were barely any at all.
3_bj,2020-06-10,5,DELICIOUS,Chunks were found throughout and I really enjoyed ice cream so reminiscent of my fave dessert.
3_bj,2020-02-17,5,My favorite dessert as an ice cream!,"I absolutely love this flavor, and I'm glad it's back to stay and not a 'Limited Batch'"
3_bj,2020-02-25,5,PLEASE KEEP!!!!!!!,Please keep the Cannoli ice cream!!!!! It is the best EVER!!!!!
3_bj,2020-05-24,5,My FAVORITE is back!!!,"Ben and Jerry’s limited batch Cannoli ice cream single handedly got me through law school!!! I have literally written the website 100s of times begging them to bring it back!! For years I have regaled my now fiancé with tales of the elusive, delicious limited batch Cannoli ice cream. Well fast forward about a decade and in walks my fiancé carrying not 1, not 2, but 3 pints of the permanent Cannoli pint. It’s just as delicious as I remember."
3_bj,2020-05-26,1,Horrible,"I usually love Ben & Jerry but this ice cream was horrible. It tastes nothing like a cannoli. I was so excited to eat this, and looked everywhere for it, and it's a total let down. The ""cannoli shells"" taste like waffle cones, and the mascarpone tastes horrible. This has a after taste and honestly just a total let down."
3_bj,2020-06-10,1,"Strange strong flavor, mix ins sparse.","I was a big fan of the retired* Holy Cannoli. This version has a strange strong flavor from 1st taste. The mix ins were sparse, which was not right** regardless of whether I liked the flavor or not.
*Original was ricotta and pistachio ice cream with chocolate covered cannoli and roasted pistachios. It bombed and was retired one year later.
**Pint bottom: NOV0921BJ1 5095 22:59 67867261."
3_bj,2020-05-24,2,If you like cake frosting...,"If you like cake frosting... then this is your ice cream. I don’t taste cannoli not even in the least. Just sugar, like cake frosting. I do like the chocolate coated pastry pieces but they were few and far between. I will eat it because i paid a lot of money for it. But pretty disappointed. There isnt any cinnamon flavor or rose water like i put in my homemade cannoli. :-("
3_bj,2020-06-13,2,Not as good as the prior Holy Cannoli,"Holy Cannoli was my second favorite Ben & Jerry's of all time. When I heard it was coming back as Cannoli, I couldn't wait to find it locally. Unfortunately, I was disappointed as it had changed from ""Creamy Ricotta and Pistachio Ice Cream with Chocolate Covered Cannolis and Roasted Pistachios"" and didn't taste as good. Bring back the old Holy Cannoli!"
3_bj,2020-04-12,2,Nothing like a real cannoli.,Chocolate chip cannoli is one of my favorite desserts. I grew up in Boston and know great cannoli. So I was very excited to try this flavor.
3_bj,2020-03-10,3,Meh,Not my favorite.....Tastes nothing like a Cannoli.
3_bj,2020-05-20,2,Well....,"Your Cannoli ice cream
Which claims to be Sicily’s finest in flavors, is a complete abomination to the Italian community.
If you’re going to label the thick, creamy, tangy Italian cheese TWICE in your label, I should be able to taste it. Or better yet!!- see it in the ingredients list. Please refine this product.
Thank you"
3_bj,2020-07-13,4,Good Not bad,"So one thing I love about this ice cream is the crunchy waffle cones covered in chocolate it’s very similar to Americone dream but I think I still prefer the American dream better because of the plain vanilla flavor with caramel.
This one I know is supposed to be the mascarpone flavor. It’s not bad but not my favorite."
3_bj,2020-03-01,3,Needs more bits!,"This ice cream is very good, however I think that it would benefit from having more cannoli bits in it. If it’s called cannoli it should have more cannoli in it."
3_bj,2020-08-03,5,My favorite,"I love cannolis and I love this ice cream but I wouldn't say they taste the same. This is really rich. On my first bite I thought it was a bit too strong, but it really grew on me. Love hitting those mascarpone swirls, and the pastry shell pieces are nice and crunchy. Happy it's permanent to the line."
3_bj,2020-06-13,1,Would have preferred Holy Cannoli,I was so excited to see this. I was a little concerned when I saw that it was made with mascarpone ... which has no place in a true Sicilian cannoli. I should have known ... this is only what a grocery store cannoli would possibly taste like. Bring back the REAL cannoli ice cream: Holy Cannoli.
3_bj,2020-05-02,4,Good stuff!,"Found Cannoli in my store recently and decided to give it a try, as I'm from a predominantly Italian area and a fan of the real pastry. Tasty ice cream, super creamy and fun. Could use a bit more of the cannoli bits, though, which was the only reason it didn't get 5 stars. Still a top 5!"
3_bj,2020-04-13,2,Underwhelming,"Not sure how this is a “fan favorite”... the ice cream base is this weird artificial vanilla, the mascarpone swirl is this gritty, undercooked batter and the fudge cone flakes literally feel and taste like cardboard. I WOULDNT recommend this flavor unless you enjoying wasting your money"
3_bj,2020-07-03,1,First Ben & Jerry's Flavor I did not like,"I'm a big Cannoli fan. The filling is so important but so his the shell. This just didn't taste like cannoli to me at all. I'm a native New Yorker and perhaps the filling and shells here are not typical of the rest of the country, but both sure are gold standard in my book"
3_bj,2020-04-19,5,Love it,Fantastic. Saw this in the store while working out of town in Jacksonville. Let’s just say the Publix gets bought out every-time I go. Since I can’t find Cinnabon anywhere this one is my new go to. Netflix and chilled is tasty as well classic favorites in one for that one
3_bj,2020-05-05,5,NEW FAVORITE,"Wow. This ice cream is soooo good! So good I had to write this review lol. I think it could use a bit more cannoli pieces but regardless it's an awesome ice cream. Do yourself a favor and try it, it's for sure a new favorite of mine and I hope it sticks around forever"
3_bj,2020-08-14,1,Terrible!,I was so excited to find ice cream that allegedly tasted like cannolis. It tasted like utter disappointment! It tasted absolutely nothing like cannolis! This mediocre monstrosity was literally just butterscotch with bits of chocolate covered waffle cones.
3_bj,2020-05-11,5,"Tried it, loved it!","Not finding Chunky Monkey, I took home Cannoli and am so glad I did! I ate the whole pint in one sitting... good lord! I loved the still crispy bits hidden inside that lusciousness... yum! Hope this one makes it into the big league as a regular flavor."
3_bj,2020-05-11,5,AMAZING,This ice cream is by far the best ice cream I've ever had from Ben and Jerry's. Big fan of cannolis and they could not have done a better job. The mascarpone swirls are to die for and I am proud to call this my happiness in a spoon!
3_bj,2020-06-26,1,Did you have anyone who has eaten a cannoli taste,I bought this tonight and it is straight up vanilla ice cream with chocolate chips. Did there taste testers actually ever have a cannoli? This had no resemblance to the taste of a cannoli. So upset this was a flavor failure
3_bj,2020-07-31,5,New Favorite,I was really skeptical of the flavor because I’ve never had a cannoli before but I decided to try it because the americone was out at my grocery store and WOW! Genuinely this is my new favorite flavor *chef’s kiss*
3_bj,2020-03-19,5,Best. Ice cream. Ever.,I've waited YEARS for this flavor to return.... Nothing compares. Thank you for bringing it back! Please don't ever take it away again.... I don't want to live in a world that doesn't include cannoli ice cream!
3_bj,2020-06-17,1,Holy cannoli this was awful,"I love cannolis. This was no cannoli. Weird tasting ice cream. Hardly any mix ins, which was probably good because they just tasted like cardboard covered on chocolate. Don't waste your money or calories."
3_bj,2020-09-20,5,So happy it's back,Deliciously Different. The marscapone swirl is the best
3_bj,2020-07-20,5,Perfect sweetness,I bought this at the food store yesterday eager to try it. I honestly didn’t expect it to be nearly as good as it was! It’s just so sweet and creamy and the chocolate pieces add the perfect crunch.
3_bj,2020-08-14,4,goood,people always complain that things never taste like the thing theyre supposed to but is that a reason to hate it? its good i dont care if it tastes like candy corn just a little its still nice
3_bj,2020-05-11,5,One of my all-time faves,"I shed a tear in the grocery store when I saw that they brought this flavor back. It's the perfect balance of sweet and creamy with delicious chocolate, pastry shell crunchies. YUM!"
3_bj,2020-03-29,5,TAKE THE CANNOLI!,Literally the most scrumptious B&J’s flavor I have ever had. I ate the whole pint *accidentally* in 6 minutes. I have built a shrine to its perfection in my fridge. FREAKING YUMMY!
3_bj,2020-03-26,5,Thank you for bringing this back!,This redux is better than the original cannoli flavor that I tried. The mascarpone made it softer than many other flavors and it wasn’t overly sweet like some flavors.
3_bj,2020-08-23,5,Best flavor I've had,I have a sweet tooth but Ice Cream is usually lower on my list of must have treats. This ice cream changed that for me. Love it. Happy it is back for good!!
3_bj,2020-04-07,5,Absolutely decadent!!,I am an absolute cannoli fanatic and to see that there is a cannoli flavored ice cream just blew my mind! I had to try it! Absolutely delicious and decadent
3_bj,2020-06-25,5,Best ice cream ever!,The perfect combo of crunch from the chocolate covered cannoli cookie and swirls of mascarpone I really hope this isn’t one of those ones that’s temporary!
3_bj,2020-06-30,5,So delicious,"I got to try this flavor just the other day, and I am sure glad I did. This ice cream is one of the beat ben and Jerry's flavors I've had"
3_bj,2020-06-15,2,Weirdly Artificial Tasting,"Tastes nothing like a cannoli. Overly sweet, cloying ice cream with a strong artificial flavor and aftertaste. Would not buy again"
3_bj,2020-09-09,2,Swirl texture is a little off,"The flavor was okay, the chocolate covered pieces were a bit chewy. The swirl going through it had a bit of a grainy texture"
3_bj,2020-09-15,1,Disappointing,I LOVE cannolis but this flavor missed the mark! It could have been amazing but it was so boring and not creamy.
3_bj,2020-09-04,5,Great Taste and Texture!,"The store I went to didn’t have the B and Js flavor I wanted, I am so glad I grabbed cannoli instead!"
3_bj,2020-05-11,5,My New Favorite!!,This is my new favorite ice cream - hands down!! Absolutely love the all the flavors and textures!!
3_bj,2020-05-18,5,Sicilian treat by the ice cream king,Well done as always. If this ever goes away please bring it back as a seasonal holiday item
3_bj,2020-07-16,5,MY NEW FAVORITE,"I’ve never been disappointed with a Ben and Jerry’s flavor, but Cannoli is my favorite!!!"
3_bj,2020-08-31,3,"Good, But I Forgot it was in the Fridge",Decent and really sweet. But I forgot I had it. So...not so much like the real thing.
3_bj,2020-09-01,2,Too sweet,This is the first Ban and Jerry’s flavor I’m not crazy about. Wanted to like it more.
3_bj,2020-03-15,5,Can i suggest a rename?,Awesome! I would have named it holy cannoli! Thank you for thinking of this one.!
3_bj,2020-05-14,5,Delicious,I love cannolis and this is one of my new favorites!
3_bj,2020-06-05,5,Excellent!,Great flavor. It is so rich and delicious I love it!
3_bj,2020-08-29,5,Favorite,yassss! Love you so much..........................
4_bj,2018-12-04,5,best flavor hands down,This is my favorite flavor in the entire world please make it a permanent flavor!! I made all my friends go out and try it and we're all addicted. I have three pints a week. I wish I was joking. We single handedly bought all of the Gimme S'more stock in our grocery store. The day this flavor is retired is the day my happiness dies. :)
4_bj,2018-09-06,5,Smart way to make a Smore's flavor,"I have several favorite B&J's flavors, but I decided to go outside of my usual and get this flavor. With the first bite you can definitely taste a hint of marshmallow-y flavor in the base ice cream. It's different than just plain vanilla. I think they did a great job capturing that flavor. The chocolate cookie swirl and graham swirl is smart and I think it's a unique way to add the classic flavor of a smore. And of course, you can't go wrong with fudge flakes! I am a total mix-in and swirl junkie, the more the better, and Ben & Jerry's never disappoints with that! Great job on this flavor! Overall a unique take on a novel summer treat!"
4_bj,2019-08-21,5,Way better than the OG S'mores!,"I've had many pints of the Gimme S'more while it's been out and tonight I accidentally grabbed the original S'mores, with the chocolate ice cream. It was the most disappointing moment when I opened the pint to find chocolate ice cream instead of the typical golden ice cream I was used to with the Gimme S'more. Gimme S'more is the perfect representation of what a S'more is: mostly composed of perfectly toasted marshmallows, hint of chocolate, and a great trail of graham crackers. I will be so sad when this pint leaves the shelves. And I will never make the mistake of buying the OG S'mores pint again. Too much chocolate to represent a S'more."
4_bj,2018-04-25,5,My New Favorite,"I recently had the pleasure of taking a tour of Ben & Jerry's in VT and this was the flavor sample of the day. Instantly, I was hooked. I've been buying some from my local CT grocery store since. There was a sale one night and the store was out. I sat on the floor and cried. While the ice cream base may not taste exactly like marshmallows, is delicious. Everything about this flavor is amazing!"
4_bj,2019-02-14,5,BEST FLAVOR EVER!!!,"I am so sad that this is a limited batch. Gimme S'more is my all time favorite flavor and I've tried almost all the Ben & Jerry's flavors. It is like heaven in your mouth. The graham cracker swirl and chocolate cookie swirl are my two favorite things about this ice cream. Since the flavor is slowly leaving, my friends and I have gone to multiple stores to stock up on what is left. As you can tell we LOVE Gimme S'more and if you're a s'mores lover like me then it's worth the try!"
4_bj,2018-10-30,5,"Breathe, it’s gonna be ok.","This is such a great new pint! I stocked up and my freezer is loaded with them. The ice cream, the swirls and chunks are so so yummy! If I could eat it every night, I would. This is a LIMITED BATCH! It did not replace S’mores. It’s still available in stores and online. Gimme S’more has come and will go again and regular S’mores will remain. The very first S’mores was retired but the one we’ve been enjoying for quite a while now is still there. So enjoy this for what it is and have your regular S’mores too."
4_bj,2018-04-03,5,New Favorite Flavor,"This is so delicious! It tastes like an amped up cookies and cream but with a graham cracker taste. A S'more is like a cookie so I'm not complaining. I also like it better than the Original. This is my new favorite flavor! I don't think the base tastes like regular vanilla at all. It may not be marshmallow-y, but it's definitely a ""warm, dark"" and border-lining a faint molasses flavor versus a sweet, strong vanilla if that makes sense. This is my new addiction. I think newbie Ben and Jerry's consumers will take a liking to this one."
4_bj,2020-06-09,1,A worse version of the old one,"I was having trouble finding my favorite flavor of B&J at the store, when I came accross this one that seemed to be an overhauled version of it. I bought it and took it home only to discover that it tastes nothing like smores. The chocolate cookies are good but have a really out of place flavor. They definitely should have had a soft fudge swirl or something instead. The graham crackers are the best part, but there just weren't enough. And the ice cream which says its ""toasted marshmallow"" flavor just tastes like vanilla. Overall very disappointing not just as a replacement for the old smores but for ben and jerry's in general. I really did not like this one."
4_bj,2018-04-28,4,"Not quite S'mores, but tasty nonetheless.","The new S'mores flavor is much better than the standard flavor from the company. Ben and Jerry's wisely made the decision to use a marshmallow base instead of chocolate, so it doesn't overpower the other components. The base tastes more like sweet cream than marshmallow but when combined with the fudge flakes and graham cracker, the result tastes very close to the real deal. My only complaints are that the chocolate cookie crumbs overpower what little graham cracker there is, losing the theme a little. And the fudge flakes are strangely limited. Still, the components all come together to provide a tasty flavor, and I hope this limited edition lasts as long as possible."
4_bj,2018-06-25,5,Best EVER,"Honestly, I don't love ice cream. It's my least favorite dessert. But, about once a year I get a craving. I saw the Gimme S'more ice cream in the store and love s'mores so thought I'd give it a shot. Total game changer. This is the best ice cream I've ever had and I've ended up buying it like 7 times. I'm so sad it's limited edition and hope it becomes permanent. It's perfectly simple and complex-I wouldn't change a thing. I'm reviewing in hopes marketing people see its ratings and decide to keep it!!"
4_bj,2019-04-11,5,Bring it back!!!,"I first tasted this heavenly creation on Dec 24th... And boy what a Christmas Miracle it was. The target I visited was out of my previous favorite Milk and Cookies, and I want in the mood for the ""chocolatey-ness"" of my other favorite the Tonight Dough."
4_bj,2018-08-21,2,Prefer original S’mores flavor,"I feel like this is a just a sweet vanilla ice cream with a cookie swirl, like cookies and cream. There was no noticeable marshmallow flavor, and occasionally I could taste the graham cracker. I much prefer the chocolate based s’mores flavor which was rich chocolate, and a creamy marshmallow, with the perfect amount of crumbly graham cracker. Really, what do you remember about s’mores over the campfire? The melted Hershey chocolate and the gooey toasted marshmallow, followed by the crumbly graham cracker. This new flavor really doesn’t have any of that except the memory of the gritty graham cracker, which was really only there to hold onto the chocolate and marshmallow."
4_bj,2020-06-19,5,Top favorite flavor!!,"I made it my goal that I’m going to try every single flavor of B&J that I can possibly get my hands on. And out of 10+ flavors so far, this is one of my favorites! I have tried the phish and loved it! I wondered how it would taste with a little bit of crunch and so I decided to try this and it did not disappoint!!! The fact this is actually a TOASTED MARSHMALLOW flavored ice cream!!! BOMB. and not only does it contain graham crackers but CHOCOLATE COOKIES BITS too. And of course a generous amount of chocolate chunks and the hints of fudge. GENIUS.
They really did it with this ice cream guys. I’m so blessed I got my hands on this."
4_bj,2018-03-29,5,"All I kept thinking was ""oh man, oh man!""","I literally just bought this 20 minutes ago, put a little bit in a bowl, and decided I had to write the review. I agree with one reviewer where they said the marshmallow ice-cream doesn't really taste like marshmallow. However, I feel like that's a really difficult flavor to capture and the overall execution was very good. I totally tasted the graham cracker pieces and I LOVE the chocolate cookies BJ puts in their ice-cream. If I had to make a critique or suggestion, I would say maybe have more graham cracker swirls and/or flavor the ice-cream graham cracker and have marshmallow swirls with the cookie and graham crackers? I don't know though because I'm pretty overkill with my ice-cream. If it doesn't sound like I'm going to die it wouldn't be my first choice. All in all, I am so happy, I'm struggling to not get more, and I would be very sad if this never came back."
4_bj,2019-06-25,5,Gimme S'moreeee,"Please bring this flavor back. I noticed one love came back again this year so ive been waiting to see this one too especially since I can't imagine a single person who tried this didn't love it. I saw one person in their review said they ate 3 pints a week. I ate a whole pint every single day the whole time it was available. Bought my grocery store out every time they restocked. I still have 3 or 4 a week but no other flavor compares to this one, not even my old favorite. This ice cream ruins all other ice creams."
4_bj,2020-02-26,1,I have never been let down more,"The original s'mores ice cream was a dream come true, it was by far my favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor and I even drove to Vermont to tour the facility and get a cone there. When I tried this replacement I had hope to be wowed but was left feeling nothing but disappointment. S'mores do not have cookies in them so I am not sure where that idea came from, and normally I would like cookies in my ice cream but if I am looking for the flavor profile of a s'more this ice cream just doesn't deliver."
4_bj,2018-04-15,1,Why change a good thing?,"My favorite flavor of Ben and Jerry’s is S’mores, which I have been a fan of since it was called Marsha Marsha Marshmallow but it is the HARDEST flavor to find! I saw Gimme S’more in my grocery and got so excited! But when I got home, I was disappointed. I thought my favorite part of S’mores was the graham cracker swirls which are also in this flavor, but it turns out, the Chocolate ice cream was more vital to the awesomeness of the flavor than I thought. The “toasted marshmallow” Ice cream just tastes like vanilla. While the add-ins are good, the ice cream part of this pint leaves something to be desired. I guess I’ll forever be on the hunt for my fave flavor “S’mores” because you can’t beat it! They shouldn’t have changed a good thing!"
4_bj,2019-07-24,5,PLEASE BRING IT BACK,"I need this flavor to return. This was my favorite flavor of ice cream ever and I would buy multiple pints of it out of fear that I would go to the store one day and the “limited batch” ice cream would be gone. My heart broke as I checked the Ben and Jerry’s section of the freezer and saw that there was no more and it wasn’t coming back. PLEASE bring this back even for just a month so I can buy every stores stock. I’m serious, every time I eat ice cream now I just feel like it isn’t the same as gimme s’mores. I still check the ice cream section at every store I go to and I will continue to do so till it comes back :("
4_bj,2018-11-11,2,"Ok, but NOWHERE near as good as the original.","Don't get me wrong, it isn't bad. It's fine. But I'm docking it one star because it comes nowhere close to the original S'mores flavor--this strikes me as a disappointing remix. The ice cream itself tastes closer to sweet cream than toasted marshmallow, and it lacks enough chocolate to actually compare it to a s'more--chocolate is supposed to be a constant component of the dessert! While I prefer the original's chocolate base regardless; if this flavor had more chocolate chunks and a toasted marshmallow swirl like the original, it might be a lot better. But as it stands, OG S'mores is still my favorite ice cream flavor ever and this simply doesn't come anywhere close to it."
4_bj,2020-07-14,4,So glad they went back to the original recipe,"I loved the 2014 version of Gimie S‘ more. I was so disappointment when the ice cream flavor was changed to chocolate. That being said, once they brought back the toasted marshmallow flavored ice cream, I was thrilled. I liked the chocolate cookies, but the ice cream felt more like cookies and cream than s’mores, so I just added my own crushed graham crackers. EVEN MORE RECENTLY I noticed they changed the recipe, again. This time it was perfected!! I no longer have to add my own graham crackers."
4_bj,2019-06-12,3,A solid pint. Great use of flavor choice.,I bought this flavor last week while making a trip to my local scoop shop. Let me just start out by saying that smores is a hard flavor to really nail flavor wise. I really enjoyed the marshmallow ice cream. Alot of companies usually go with chocolate as a base for Smores and I think that its usually overwhelming and distracting from the marshmallow. So the star of the flavor show was definitely on point. The grahms are great and are a great topping used in alot of flavors lately. Unfortunately tgis pint suffers from the same thing most smores flavored things do and it was ultimately too sweet in my opinion. I enjoyed this pint but theres too many more to try to stop here!
4_bj,2018-04-13,1,Definitely missed the mark,"S’mores is my favorite flavor EVER. So when I saw Gimme S’mores in my local grocery store I almost fell over I was so excited! However the excitement was short-lived because this is not s’mores. Not even the slightest bit. If I were blindfolded and tried this, I would never guess that it is s’mores flavor. The “marshmallow” ice cream is vanilla and there is no hint of graham cracker. The most overpowering part is the chocolate cookie swirl...which is not s’mores. Don’t get me wrong, the ice cream is good! If I were rating based on taste it would get 5 Stars. But I’m rating it based on how closely it captures the s’mores flavor. If I could give it a 0 I would because this is basically The Tonight Dough without the cookie dough and chocolate ice cream. So do yourself a favor and just get that because at least you have cookie dough."
4_bj,2019-04-09,5,The Best and Most Missed,"This was the best s'more flavored edible substance I have ever consumed. Every time I saw ""Limited Batch"" on the label, I dreaded the day that would be my last time seeing it on the shelves. Mercy shone upon me each time, though, as upon return to my home, all the dread melted away as I rejoiced and beheld Heaven's essence grace my mouth with the textured, creamy delight of Gimme S'more. Alas, the day finally encroached upon my innocent self that I would see in its stead, ""One Love"". I've since settled for Milk&Cookies which I know can never fill the void once occupied by the dessert of unmatched divinity. I dream that one day I'll once again taste the treasure graciously gifted to this unworthy world by the great Ben and Jerry."
4_bj,2018-06-04,5,Best s’mores ice cream I’ve had!,"Way better than the previous s’mores recipe. Fantastic! I sat down with the pint and before I knew it, it was gone. Oops!"
4_bj,2018-06-22,2,Flavor regrets,"As a long time fan of Ben & Jerry's, I have favorite flavors I always want. Being summer and seeing the store did not have any of my favorites, I thought I would try this ""new"" flavor. I have to say, it is not at all what I was hoping for. I am a marshmallow junkie and was hoping for toasted marshmallow flavor; instead, I felt like I was eating vanilla chocolate chip with some of those cake crunchies that you find in ice cream cakes. I will go back to my regular flavors or skip buying if Gimme S'more is my only other option."
4_bj,2018-10-07,5,The real deal!,"I have been a hard-core regular cookie dough ice cream only fan for YEARS, but this flavor caught my eye at the beginning of summer and I haven't been able to buy any other ice cream since! It's the amazing cookie swirl that almost convinced me that I could love the Tonight Dough flavor, despite my hatred for the nasty peanut butter dough. And the ever so creamy toasted marshmellow ice cream was a pleasant surprise! Even the graham cracker swirl blends in perfectly so you don't feel like you have random dry crumbs messing up the texture! It's the perfect combination that at times tastes like what an Oreo ice cream should taste like! I haven't had my go-to cookie dough ice cream in over 4 months and will be incredibly sad when this masterpiece goes away!"
4_bj,2018-07-15,1,The original S'mores is better,"This flavor does not remind me of S'mores at all. Why cookies? The chocolate flakes are more like big pieces... too big for this. I couldn't even finish the container. It wasn't worth it. first time I've done that with Ben & Jerry's. Hopefully you'll never quit making the original S'mores, even if they are only in the shops."
4_bj,2020-06-24,5,Best ice cream I’ve ever had in my life,I had an ad pop up on my Instagram timeline for this ice cream and I went and found it at my local H-E-B. The next day I went back and they were out. I went to 4 Walmart’s and 3 more H-E-B’s with no luck until I finally found it at target. I have now bought all the pints from my local target. Please send more every where in San Antonio. I need it to live at this point LOL
4_bj,2018-07-08,5,S’mores :),"I really enjoyed this flavor! I was excited to try this flavor because the other s’mores flavor has chocolate has the ice cream which I personally don’t like, so I was very happy to see this one with a marshmallow ice cream! I will say, marshmallow is a hard flavor
to replicate, so the ice cream tasted more like vanilla to me. This flavor would have benefited from marshmellow bits mixed in. The chocolate cookie swirl and graham cracker swirl were amazing and crunchy! These swirls delivered on the s’mores flavor for me!"
4_bj,2018-03-28,3,Not what I was expecting.,"I love s’mores, and don’t get me wrong this flavor is great, but not what I wanted. I was expecting more of a s’mores flavor, and I would explain this ice cream as more of a “marshmallow cookie crunch.” It’s still good! Just not s’mores. It would be better with gooey marshmallows :)"
4_bj,2018-04-09,1,A miss unfortunately,"I just bought this as well as my staple, cookie dough. Cookie dough was as usual amazing but this one was just a miss for me. It reminded me of the pint slices, not nearly enough toppings or pieces. It was mostly vanilla ice cream with some cookie pieces in it. Definitely not enough marshmallows to make it feel like a s'mores ice cream. Anyway, I love most of B&Js flavors but this one wasn't for me"
4_bj,2018-05-31,5,Breaks my Heart this is Only Limited Batch,"I like ice cream and I eat a fair amount of it but never have I had an ice cream that haunts my dreams like this one. This ice cream might actually be perfect. The toasted marshmallow base is excellent and not too sweet and the flakes of chocolate add the perfect crunch to the blend. I'm not a big chocolate ice cream fan and I think that making the base marshmallow allows all of the flavors to be appreciated as one instead of being overpowered by chocolate. However, by far my favorite part of this ice cream is the graham cracker fudge swirl. Holy moley! It has a fantastic texture and the taste leads me on a whirlwind adventure. I don't know what I have to do to make this more than just a limited batch but I will do it. Every time I go to the grocery store I hold my breath that it will still be there waiting for me, cool and delicious."
4_bj,2018-04-24,5,Tastes so good it should be illegal,"This is my new favorite ice cream. While I agree that the base ice cream is not an exact replica of marshmallows, it does not taste like plain vanilla... more like the melted gooey inside of a marshmallow that’s not actually warm or gooey. The add ins are perfection to me between the swirls graham and chocolate cookie I’m in ice cream heaven. I have to carefully calculate my purchases so this is the only cheat on my diet each week! I hope it goes from “limited batch” to “here to stay”!"
4_bj,2018-04-30,5,beyond expectation,"I love a good vanilla based ice cream flavor, and this did not disappoint. I was skeptical to try to the flavor because of the reviews that were already posted but it was amazing. I loved the graham cracker bits. people complain it's not like the regular smores flavor, uh hello duh the smores flavor already exists and is still in stores. This a tasty spin-off and does not disappoint"
4_bj,2018-10-15,5,Favorite Flavor!,I have been buying this consistently for about 5 weeks almost like twice a week because I cannot get enough of this flavor. It’s honestly unhealthy for me at this point and for my bank account because I barely bought ice cream before taking a chance on this one. Delicious! The cookies and graham crackers are amazing in it. I literally went through the process of giving my info just so I could write this review in hopes that the flavor is continued and more people improve upon their lives by buying this flavor.
4_bj,2018-04-02,2,Glorified cookies n cream,"Hmm tasty but not s’mores. Just tasted like cookies n cream with some extra chocolate chunks. No graham cracker flavor. Wish the base actually tasted like toasted marshmallow, but unfortunately the flavor isn’t coming through. Oh well!!"
4_bj,2018-04-29,1,Please rename this to Cookies and Creme,I love Ben and Jerry’s but they missed the mark on this one. This is nothing even faintly reminiscent of S’mores ice cream. Now this one replaced the original S’mores and I can’t find it. Very disappointed.
4_bj,2019-04-14,5,I need this to be a permanent addition!,I love this flavor. Forget s'mores because that one is just old news. I bought and stocked up my freezer but now I am eating the one last pint... Please bring it back soon
4_bj,2019-03-22,5,My greatest Ice-Cream Memory,"I first tried this flavor with my best friend and became hooked the moment those flavors hit my palate. I’ve gone through 6 pints within a week (multiple times), trying to savor the limited batch that was created (also in hopes of raising the number of pints sold, encouraging your company to keep them on the grocery shelves). There was never a time I’d leave the grocery without one of these pints. Until, my local grocery store finally ran out."
4_bj,2018-05-20,1,The old S'mores was so much better!!!,"The previous S'mores was so much better. The chocolate ice cream tasted much better than the marshmallow one. When I went to the store and didn't see the other one anymore (which btw was my favorite flavor ever!) and saw this one I decided to give it a try, but overall I was very disappointed. The ice cream itself is not good and the chocolate cookies do not taste like s'mores to me. Please bring the old one back!!!"
4_bj,2018-04-10,2,Overall NOT S'mores!,It's vanilla ice cream not toasted marshmallow. That alone was extremely disappointing. A little graham cracker swirl was ok. Just didn't go with the ice cream. I did like the chocolate cookie swirl. It basically was a cookies and cream ice cream taste. Only a little bit of fudge flakes but that's fine with me. Extremely disappointed. I love marshmallow.
4_bj,2018-12-06,5,Delicious,Gimme Smores is the best ever. My whole family loves it. Please make it a forever flavor. We can't get enough.
4_bj,2018-03-26,3,No s'mores taste,"It's ice cream, of course it still tastes good... but sadly this tasted nothing like s'mores. Marshmallow ice cream taste nothing like marshmallow, and the chocolate cookie took over the graham cracker flavor."
4_bj,2018-04-08,2,In no way is this like a s'more.,"The ice cream base is suppose to be a toasted marshmallow flavor but to me it is just vanilla ice cream. This ice cream to me tastes like cookies and cream to be honest, save your money and just make a s'more."
4_bj,2019-02-26,5,Best Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream,"Few Ice Creams in life have a perfect blend of flavor, texture, and eatability (which I know is not a word, but I have made it up for this review!). You can eat Gimme S'more! for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and still be able to find a way to have more more bite as dessert. You can eat this straight, or as a dope milkshake. I really hope this flavor sticks and goes into permanent rotation. Good job Ben and Jerry - keep up the great work!"
4_bj,2019-07-15,5,Please Bring this Back,"This ice cream deserves more than 5 stars. It is by far the best flavor of Ben and Jerry's I've ever had and every time I go to the grocery store I still check to see if MAYBE it will be back. My boyfriend and I were both obsessed with it and had all of our friends and family try it. This deserves to be so much more than just a limited edition flavor. The whole world needs to try it. I agree with the below reviewer that said when this flavor is off the shelf, their happiness died. There is a hole in my heart than can only be filled with this flavor."
4_bj,2018-09-10,5,Best new flavor in years,"Ben and Jerry’s, PLEASE keep this one around. I loved the old S’mores too but this one is so much better. I know most flavors end up in the graveyard but if this one ends up in the graveyard it will be a tradgedy on par with human trafficking."
4_bj,2018-07-12,5,Best tasting s'mores ice cream I've ever had,My girlfriend bought one for us to try. Went back and bought each our own.
4_bj,2019-02-02,2,Still needs improvement,"I like this version better than the original, however it still doesn't taste like s'mores. There needs to be a smoky element, whether that be smoked salt or bits of charred marshmallow. Also there needs to be a LOT more graham. I couldn't taste it at all. This ice cream has the potential to be amazing & legendary. It's tough to re-create the taste of a real s'more though. Hope you keep trying."
4_bj,2018-06-10,5,So glad I had it while it’s still available,Delicious! Great ice cream and the swirls are perfect! I eat my Ben and Jerry’s with one of my son’s toddler spoons to help make the pint last longer (as I always eat the whole thing) but this one I couldn’t help but take huge bites anyway. I really like this flavor! I could have maybe gone for a little marshmallow swirl in addition just for a texture contrast but that’s not a big deal.
4_bj,2019-05-26,5,"BEST ICE CREAM EVER,","I have been FEENING for this ice cream. It is hands down the best ice cream I’ve had in my entire life. Do you know how tormenting it is, to find your favorite ice cream then it goes out of stock? Then you try a million different flavors and none of them do what the Gimme s’mores does. ITS THE BEST. PLEASE. I beg you. Bring this back as a permanent flavor. The people need it."
4_bj,2018-05-29,5,best s'more flavored thing besides actual s'mores,"I am not a fan of s'mores flavored items. I like real s'mores. but this ice cream is exquisite. the graham and chocolate cookie swirl are stars of the show and on a backdrop of marshmallow ice cream, not a sharp sweet but a mellow and deep savoriness...its delicious. I had never tried the original ""S'mores"" flavor, but tried it after loving ""Gimme S'more"".. Gimme S'more is hands down the reigning champ, i feel the other s'mores tastes mostly like a rich chocolate, nowhere near as complex in flavor"
4_bj,2018-04-15,4,Definitely better than the old S'more flavor but..,"It's pretty much another cookie bit flavor similar to ""The Tonight Dough"" and ""Milk and Cookies."" It's pretty tasty though. So.... if you're expecting an authentic s'more flavor, you'll be disappointed. But if you like cookies-n-cream types compared to the two popular flavors I compared it with, you'll enjoy it."
4_bj,2018-05-11,1,Sequels are never as good.,I'm so sad they've discontinued the previous s'mores recipe for this.
4_bj,2018-06-20,3,S'more or less,"My most favorite thing in this entire world is s'mores. Anything Chocolate or marshmallow is good enough, but when you put them together it creates the world's best dessert!
Unfortunately this ice cream didn't taste anything like s'mores. It was delicious nonetheless, but I didn't taste the marshmallowy goodness that I was expecting. The ice cream tasted like regular vanilla, and there were some chocolate chunks in there. The Graham swirl was incredible and made up for the lack of toasted marshmallow flavor."
4_bj,2018-06-13,2,definitely not a s'more,"So, it's not like this ice cream is bad, but the name and description are very misleading. I would call it more of a cookies and cream because there is no marshmallows. And it's not a very good cookies and cream. Definitely one of my least favorite flavors:("
4_bj,2018-07-20,5,Better than the original,"Probably my favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor. The marshmallow ice cream is super tasty, I love the chocolate cookies. The original s'mores flavor is too chocolate-y for me, so I much prefer this one. My only complaint: I wish there were more graham crackers."
4_bj,2019-03-12,5,BEST FLAVOR EVER!!!,"This flavor absolutely tops any ice cream flavor I have ever tasted; and I love ice cream!
It may hold an extra special place in my heart as it was the sample of the day when we visited Ben and Jerry's in Vermont during a New England vacation. I have had a hard time seeing it in stock at my local grocery stores recently (and I've searched in a few) so I would love to see it more readily available and for it to be a permanent flavor! You will continue getting our business for this amazing ice cream!"
4_bj,2018-10-17,5,THE BEST,"I just bought this a few weeks ago and I wanted to try a different flavor and I was compelled to buy this one because of the description. I was very curious about this flavor but afraid it could be too sweet. After my purchase, I finished the whole pint in one sitting because the flavor is delicious! I can't get enough of this flavor. I was looking to buy a second in the grocery stores but I couldn't find any! It's apparently not sold everywhere but when you get the chance to see this flavor, do it!"
4_bj,2019-02-24,5,I Frickin Love This Flavor!,"I purchased this ice cream because I LOVE Smores but I'm not a big ice cream person (I mostly stick with vanilla bc you can't go wrong with that). After eating the entire pint in 2 days, I was basically begging my husband for another one. Thank you for taking my boring vanilla days and turning them into a rainbow filled, colorful painting I can live in. Yes, I'm a stay at home mom and my days are pretty
much the same. Please try to keep this flavor around and not bury it in a year. Thank you"
4_bj,2018-05-17,1,Ugh!,I may have gotten a bad one but there were no swirls of anything. Just specs of stuff. Plus it was very hard.
4_bj,2019-01-28,5,Loooooovvvvvve it!!!,"From the first time I laid eyes on this cream, I couldn't go back to any regular flavor lol. Seriously, this flavor is soooo much better than the other over-powered chocolate based Smores that you all have. It's texture and flavor is impeccably balanced to resemble an actual Smores. Don't judge me, but it has even come down to me buying atleast 3 pints every other week just to keep my fridge stocked for the future lol. Just please take it off of the ""Limited Batch"" list. Pleeease!!"
4_bj,2018-10-21,5,Gimme S'more Forever!,"I work at walmart. Over the summer I took to sampling a large number of different ice-cream pints, but once I discovered ""gimme s'more!"" the sampling stopped and I have settled into my favorite ice-cream. While I refuse to share my pint, I would encourage others to get their own. With this flavor, there are no regrets."
4_bj,2018-05-15,1,This should be chocolate.,I can’t find regular S’mores anywhere anymore. This is a sad excuse for a replacement if that’s what’s happening. It’s your best flavor.
4_bj,2018-05-20,2,Not smores,There are no graham crackers or marshmallow swirls. Doesn't even taste like smores. Chocolate chunks are the best part.
4_bj,2020-07-30,5,Cookie swirls are AMAZING,The chocolate cookie swirls in this blew my mind. Combined with the graham cracker and marshmallow WOW so good.
4_bj,2018-08-25,1,The Greatest Disappointment of 2018,"I brought this flavor from my local grocery store yesterday because I've been asking for S'more ice cream with toasted marshmallows forever; the wait was finally over or so I thought. Unfortunately, this is NOT S'more flavored ice cream this is however cookies in cream. The ""toasted marshmallows"" taste exactly like the cream filling in Oreos and the double chocolate cookies like the Oreo cookie – Infinite sadness."
4_bj,2020-08-22,5,Amazzzinggg!!!,Chocolate Fudge Brownie used to be my fave until I tried this. I’m SO glad I did. This stuff is heavenly!
4_bj,2018-08-07,5,I think cleaned put my local stores,"My daughter and I loved this, i hope it returns as i think weve gotten the last ones at our local grocer"
4_bj,2018-10-15,5,PLEASE MAKE THIS FLAVOR PERMANENT,"LOOK. I am a busy person. We all are. And part of what makes being a busy person so bearable is ice cream. Especially Ben and Jerry's ice cream. ESPECIALLY THIS FLAVOR. When I tell you that this is like a sweet and creamy version of every campfire memory of your youth, I mean it. It is every good part about every good flavor that makes S'mores a gosh-darn ethereal pleasure right here on earth. So get in your car, walk to your subway station, or hail the nearest rideshare or omnibus and GET SOME OF THIS BEFORE THEY TAKE IT AWAY."
4_bj,2018-09-19,5,THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!!,Literally the best ice cream ever made. My new favorite. PLEASE make this a permanent flavor!!!!!
4_bj,2018-07-10,5,Best flavor ever,Currently stuffing myself with heaven and I gotta say this is the best flavor I’ve ever had
4_bj,2018-09-09,5,My favorite!,This one is 10 times better than the other s'more one! Please keep making this one!
4_bj,2018-08-24,5,Best S'mores Ice Cream!,This ice cream is so good and I really wish Ben & Jerry's would make it year round!
4_bj,2018-09-18,5,I don't even like marshmallows,I have been on a journey to find the best Ben and Jerry's ice cream. This may be it
4_bj,2018-09-24,5,awesome flavor,So good- I’ve bought it several times. The cookie crumble is the best part.
4_bj,2018-08-25,5,AMAZING,My new favorite ice cream! So much better than the original s’mores flavor!
4_bj,2018-09-19,5,The BEST,"I’m going to be super disappointed when this flavor is gone. I love that there is ZERO chocolate ice cream, but instead wonderful graham crackers and chocolate pieces. The toasted marshmallow ice cream is perfect. This is literally the first time in 30 years I’ve been willing to spend money on Ben and Jerry’s (I don’t exactly see eye to eye with some of their views on certain policies and laws), but as long as they keep selling this, I will keep spending my money!"
4_bj,2018-09-16,5,BEST FLAVOR,Wish it wasn't a limited batch...I could eat this all year long!
4_bj,2020-08-14,5,YES,this is so good please keep this flavor forever ohhh yeahhh
4_bj,2018-07-11,5,Yes please!,I love the new Gimme S’more! It is my favorite flavor❤️❤️❤️
4_bj,2018-07-29,5,Great,Awesome flavor could be my favorite the texture is awesome
4_bj,2018-08-23,5,Love it!,One of my newest favorite flavors❤️ I hope it returns.
4_bj,2018-09-30,5,Don’t get rid of it,It’s the best! Whyyy does it have to be limited? WHY
4_bj,2018-09-28,5,MARSHMALLOW,THE MARSHMALLOW ICE CREAM IS AMAZING please restock
4_bj,2018-08-03,5,Should not be a limited batch !,"THE BEST ICE CREAM !
Please keep it around!!!"
4_bj,2018-06-21,1,Not feeling' it,"It didn't really taste like anything, just tasted like vanilla ice cream with specks of cookie and chocolate. And when I say specks, I truly mean specks. Trace evidence of flavor. Not a fan at all, tasted nothing like S'mores."
4_bj,2018-04-03,3,Not very S'mores like,It's a good flavor...... but doesn't remind me of s'mores at all. It's more like cookies and cream with graham crackers. It should have the same marshmallow creme that Fish Food has and way more chocolate chunks.
4_bj,2018-04-29,4,Give it a good ol' try,"Upon first spoon, I was overwhelmed with the disappointment of too much chocolate. I assumed that it was just another foolhardy excuse of a s'mores flavored food that would be overpowered with chocolate. However, I persevered and did not give up. As I continued on in my journey, I was greatly impressed. The marshmallow portions in the ice cream were great. was it as up to par as my usual go to staple of the Tonight Dough? No, But it was good enough to wear I would purchase again if I needed something different in my life. It does get better. Do not give up on this flavor, you really just gotta commit. Not a total fail of the s'mores flavor, which tends to be a difficult one to portray, however not a total success. It is good, though maybe not a typical s'mores. I do not think it completely captures the essence of s'mores, however I think that it is decadent and delicious enough for me to purchase again."
4_bj,2018-10-08,1,Not the best,"Please do not replace the previous s'mores flavor with this one. It hardly has any s'mores flavor at all. All I taste is marshmellow, where's the graham crackers? Nope, I do not want s'more of this one!"
4_bj,2018-05-27,1,What a let down!,"Ok, ok granted I love the original S’mores. I’m just tired of having to drive 37 miles (yes 37!) to get it. This flavor hurt my soul. The base didn’t have any flavor but sweet, the chocolate cookies part was ok. That honestly all the flavors I found. I’ll keep driving the 37 miles."
4_bj,2018-04-25,5,I need S’more,"Perfect name, because I can’t stop eating this and I need some more! Oh my gosh, this ice cream is SO good! It’s my favorite ice cream that I’ve bought in a grocery store, and my favorite Ben & Jerry’s flavor since Fossil Fuel. I’m a lover of all things smores, and this is the best smores flavored ice cream I’ve had. I’m going to cry when it’s not in stores anymore. PLEASE make this a permanent flavor, it is too good to just be limited batch!!!"
4_bj,2020-06-07,5,New favorite flavor!,"I was very disappointed when I saw my boyfriend decided to buy this flavor instead of Milk & Cookies... to the point where I ate all the ice cream in my freezer before even thinking about opening this new pint. And boy oh boy was I so wrong - the combinations of flavors in this pint exceeded all expectations and Gimme S'more has now risen the ranks to my new favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor. Don't get me wrong, I will eat ANY flavor, but now when I go to stores, I specifically search for this one! The only thing that makes me sad is that most places don't carry this flavor as it must not be as popular, but when it's available, it's embarrassing how excited I get. Don't sleep on this flavor like I did... I've never written a review for any product I've ever bought in my 27 years of life, and am happy that this is my first. I'd give it 10 stars if I could!"
4_bj,2018-05-31,5,Please keep this flavor!!,"I tried this for the first time about 3 weeks ago, and have bought an embarrassingly excessive amount since. It is so good. I love how the chocolate isn’t large chunks, and swirls with the graham cracker perfectly. Too often I find a flavor I like only to have it discontinued. Please don’t do that with Gimme S'more!! Keep it!! I promise I’ll keep eating it!!!"
4_bj,2018-06-14,5,Best Flavor By Far!,"I grabbed this flavor along with a few others when I was bringing a bunch of ice cream for a get together at my brother's home. I picked it for dessert and it was the most amazing thing I have ever eaten! When I was going home for the night, I made sure to take this pint with me!"
4_bj,2019-02-06,2,I will eat it because it is ice cream,"I will eat it because it is ice cream, and B&J makes great ice cream, but I am very disappointed in the S'more flavor. I was searching for my long lost, always hard to find, favorite flavor that I recall having a chocolate base with graham cracker and marshmallow swirls. What happened to that glorious ice cream?! I was ready to love this new version but it wasn't meant to be. If you try again, Ben & Jerry, I will too."
4_bj,2020-07-16,5,Best S'mores Ice Cream Hands Down,"This flavor is everything a s'mores should be, and I sincerely hope it becomes a permanent pint in the lineup."
4_bj,2018-04-16,5,Less than 5 stars is a joke.,Anyone who votes less than 5 stars tried the wrong ice cream.
4_bj,2018-11-15,5,Perfect,"I bought this last week on a whim and was blown away completely. I went on a quest for it today. No one had it, so I decided to try the original S’mores. You guys. This flavor is so much better than the original. The lighter base really helps the contrast of the flavors, and it’s honestly amazing. Completely worth the calories where the original isn’t. I hope I can find it again before it gets discontinued."
4_bj,2018-08-15,5,Best Flavor Combination Since Half-Baked!,"I had the pleasure of trying this flavor at the end of the tour, and it's the most excited I'd been about an ice cream flavor in fifteen years. The ice cream itself is phenomenal, as are the chocolate chips, but the FUDGE FLAKES are the winner in my book. Purchased two pints from my local supermarket (four states away) and it's just as delicious. Please, please, please, please, please keep this flavor!!"
4_bj,2018-04-03,4,Great flavor but S’mores it is not,"I was so excited to see this new flavor as I love all things s’mores. I agree with previous reviewers that it reminds me of cookies and cream. A very rich, cookies and cream. What it needs more of is graham and marshmallow, less of the cookie swirl. Having said that, I wouldn’t not buy it if I were in the mood for a little ice cream. Thanks B&J for introducing this new flavor. I hope you keep it around."
4_bj,2020-05-20,5,BEST EVER,"I was in Denver, Colorado at a scoop shop and saw the flavor ""Gimme Smore"" I read the description and it sounded good. My friends and family loved it too, and as soon as we got back home we checked if our local grocery store had it and they did! We honestly probably bought 10 of them. Once it left the stores we were devastated and emailed to make sure it would come back and happily it did!!"
4_bj,2019-02-15,5,So much better than the OG S'mores!,"I used to be diehard for the original s'mores flavor..as it became harder to find I found I just didnt love it as much anymore and I was looking for something to replace it with. Then I found this one! WOW its so good. Please leave it as a consistent flavor!
I have found I can only find it at Kroger sometimes. Publix does not seem to carry ANY new/ limited edition flavors."
4_bj,2020-05-16,3,Meh,"Honestly very underwhelming. Maybe if there were more swirls of cookie and graham cracker, or adding marshmallow swirls would help. But I definitely won’t be buying again."
4_bj,2018-07-29,5,Get rid of the other s'mores and keep this one!,"Finally a good rendition of s'mores! So smooth, love the chocolate cookie pieces! Wish it had marshmallows in it like phish food, but oh well. Don't get rid of it please!"
4_bj,2018-04-10,5,Love it beyond,This is my new favorite flavor. Tonight dough is a very close second. Hope this becomes more than a limited edition. Would be a staple in our freezer
4_bj,2018-04-13,5,So Good!,I ended up trying this flavor because they were out of my favorite. It was so much better than I expected it to be! It might be my new favorite.
4_bj,2018-04-03,5,So good! My new favorite ice cream,This is by FAR my new favorite flavor! The crunch from the cookies and graham cracker really makes it! I hope they decide to keep it around
4_bj,2018-07-10,1,Disappointed,It’s currently 1 am and I’m eating my ice cream that I have been looking forward too all day. It’s basically vanilla ice cream with cookies & grahm crackers. The ice cream does not taste like marshmallows & that’s so disappointing.
4_bj,2019-04-28,5,Great While it Lasted,"This was our favorite B&J’s flavor ever. It really tasted just like you were eating a S’mores from a campfire. It was a limited batch and it must be over because it is no longer available where we live. We tried the other B&J’s S’mores Ice Cream, while it is a good chocolate ice cream, it does not really taste like S’mores. Very disappointed it is gone."
4_bj,2018-06-02,5,"Not S’mores, But Still Delicious","This has all the elements of a s’more, but I don’t get that full s’more flavor when I eat it (I think because the marshmallow flavor isn’t very strong). That being said, it’s absolutely delicious. I love the different textures of the chocolate and graham cracker, and I had to stop myself from going back for more. I will definitely be buying this again!"
4_bj,2020-06-11,1,Very Disappointing!!,"I bought this for the 1st time when I couldn't find my favorite ""S'mores"" at the store. Very disappointing!! Tastes nothing like a s'more. It reminded me of a cookies and cream type flavor but not even as good! Please bring back the ""S'mores"" flavor! With it's toasted marshmallow, graham crackers and dark chocolate ice cream, it was delicious!!!"
4_bj,2018-04-24,5,Yummy,"I shared this with my five-year-old great nephew, and he said it was the best ice cream he's ever had."
4_bj,2018-04-30,5,Please make this a permanent flavor!,"I absolutely LOVE this flavor! If I’m being honest, I don’t think it has an overwhelming ”s’mores” flavor, but I love it anyhow. The cookies have a great flavor, and the texture of the graham crackers is wonderful!"
4_bj,2018-06-09,4,I’ll eat s’more of this,Great flavor. The texture of the cookie is spot on. I’ll be disappointed to see this one go.
4_bj,2018-10-30,5,Please Keep This Flavor!,DELICIOUS! This ice cream has great texture and tastes amazing. I can't wait to get more.
4_bj,2018-06-07,5,New Favorite Flavor,This is my new favorite flavor! I hope they decide to make this a permanent addition!
4_bj,2018-04-25,5,New family favorite!,"My whole family loves this ice cream! We tried this flavor during the factory tour in VT. When we got home, we bought the last 3 at our local market. Please make this a permanent favor! PLEEEEEEEASE!"
4_bj,2018-05-12,5,Make this a permanent flavor please,Magnificent.. best flavor out of all B&J I’ve tried. Keep it a permanent flavor!
4_bj,2018-06-08,5,Favorito,"Fave B&J ever! This should be a forever flavor, not limited batch! Puh-lease!"
4_bj,2020-06-15,5,Best flavor,"Been getting this one for years. Its my favorite.
The only thing i do not taste is the marshmellow.
So please throw a marshmellow swirl in this and ill love you forever."
4_bj,2018-07-06,5,Two words: Ah Mazing,Why is this only a 4/5? People seriously...this is an epic epicurean delight
4_bj,2018-06-25,5,Favorite new flavor,Wish it wasn't a limited batch. My doctor is glad it is though. LOL
4_bj,2018-06-24,5,My favorite!,I am obsessed with this flavor. Wishing it wasn’t a limited batch!
4_bj,2018-05-17,5,Best s’mores ice cream,"Stocked my freezer with it, really wish it wasn’t limited batch"
4_bj,2018-06-20,5,The best yet,"Hands down fravorite flavor yet, and I’ve had a lot of them"
4_bj,2019-01-13,5,When I need a pick-me-up...,"I have never been so passionate about an ice-cream flavor than I am with Ben & Jerry's ""Gimme S'mores!"""
4_bj,2018-07-12,5,Best Flavor on EARTH,"Literally my new absolute FAVORITE icecream ever. It’s PERFECT. It’s all my favorite flavors together all in one and that chocolate cookie swirl is to die for and omg that graham cracker is just heaven, not too chocolately and that marshmallow icecream just ties it aallllll together. Amazing. Exquisite. Must have with every meal."
4_bj,2018-05-24,5,Better than the actual s’mores flavor,"Sooooo good, my new favorite flavor of Ben and jerrys!!!"
4_bj,2018-07-31,5,Best flavor EVER!!!!!,"After my first pint I never looked back. Iv eaten more of this ice cream in the past few months then Iv eaten any ice cream in my entire life lol. If you like smores (or ice cream) then you need to try this. The only bad part is that it says limited batch . ""I hope they do us all a flavor, keep this one around for us to savor ""."
4_bj,2018-03-24,4,"Great ice cream, but really S’more","The overall ice cream was really delicious, but it didn’t really taste like a s’more. The actual ice cream did not taste enough like marshmallow, would have loved to have actual marshmallow swirl in it like some of the other B&J flavors. Tastes more like cookies and cream with some extr little extra chocolate chocolate pieces."
4_bj,2018-04-27,5,Great taste!,"For days, I have been stocking up on this flavor. The graham cracker and cookie swirls are the pints' best features!! I would love to see this become a permanent flavor!"
4_bj,2020-05-11,5,Favorite flavor!!!,"Oh my gosh I’m so happy they brought this flavor back! I was obsessed with it during the summer and I was so sad it went away, but I just saw it at my grocery store and just about freaked out. The texture from the marshmallow is so nice and the flavors are just perfect. My favorite Ben & Jerry’s flavor, hands down."
4_bj,2018-04-26,5,Amazing taste!,"This is now my favorite Ben and Jerry’s I’ve cream! I love the toasted marshmallow taste, and the fudge ripple and graham cracker swirl are to die for!"
4_bj,2018-07-07,1,Not buying it.,This is a horrible job of fixing something that wasn’t broken. Where is my S’mores!?!? I can only find this gross imposter where it used to be.
4_bj,2018-05-02,5,NEW FAVORITE FLAVOR,I’ve been buying this flavor left and right ever since I first tried it — it is my new favorite and I just can’t seem to get enough!!
4_bj,2018-05-02,5,Best ice cream ever!,This is my most favorite ice cream ever! I don't normally right reviews on anything but I want Ben&jerry to make this all the time!!
4_bj,2019-02-11,5,Best flavor all time,I have been searching for this flavor for weeks after finding one perfect pint of it. This is what cookies&cream would taste like in an ideal world. Sweet marshmallow ice cream base with a textured Graham cracker swirl is everything a s'mores ice cream should be. I desperately want to find this again!
4_bj,2018-05-01,5,Best Flavor Yet!,"I cannot say enough about this delicious treat! The sugary graham cracker bits and chocolate cookie pieces...incredible!!!!! If I wasn't already married, this ice cream would for definitely ensure the fact that I would be single forever, which, for this ice cream, would be totally worth it!!!!!!"
4_bj,2018-09-12,5,The best!!!,"This is my favorite ice cream. I’ve always been a lover of Half Baked and never ventured out of my comfort zone, but now I’ll never go back. I seriously want to buy pints of this and keep it in my freezer for the 2 years that it is apparently good for. PLEASE make this a permanent flavor!!!"
4_bj,2018-04-22,5,MY FAVORITE,"I really just wanted to break from my usual and when I saw this and it wasn't a chocolate based ice cream, I just had to get it. The last time I went to buy a pint, it was out but today when I went there were some, so just to be on the safe side, I bought two because I love it so much!!"
4_bj,2018-10-18,5,Delicious!!!,"This is by far my new favorite ice cream from Ben and Jerry's! It says ""limited batch"" on the container, but I hope this becomes a permanent flavor! I will eat this year round. The marshmallow ice cream is amazing and paired with the chocolate cookie pieces and graham crackers, to die!"
4_bj,2018-04-28,5,Top 3 Ben and Jerry Ice creams,I bought this because it was limited addition thinking it would be mediocre. But it was amazing.5/5
4_bj,2018-04-28,5,New favorite!!,Literally my new favorite flavor. Possibly the best one yet. I hope they make it a forever flavor!
4_bj,2018-10-08,5,This is the best they've ever made.,"I was on a strict diet and hadn't touched B&J for months. Saw this in the grocery store and didn't even hesitate to take two pints. I love s'mores and I hate chocolate ice cream. It turned out to be even better than my other favorite (Milk and Cookies, which is btw a fight to find in any store because it's bought out so quick).
This ice cream is so good (and also a limited batch) that I drove to every grocery store in the area and bought all of the pints available (about 10 pints were left) because they were ALL on closeout and they were going so fast that I didn't want to risk taking the time to go and get a basket when I found more that 2 in a freezer and just bare-armed carried all of them to the register before someone else could. This is not an insane, ice-cream obsessed town, its a normal town. These are normal people. This ice cream is RIDICULOUS its TOO GOOD. If they don't bring this back as a regularly stocked product I will consider it one of the greatest food related tragedies of my life."
4_bj,2018-04-20,5,Wow.,Just when I thought Oat of this Swirrled was the best thing EVER. You guys made this flavor.
4_bj,2018-05-31,5,BETTER THAN THE SMORES FLAVOR,I crave that cookie taste all of the time. Please make this permanent! I accidentally got the smores flavor thinking it was the same and boy was I wrong. The smores one is just plain chocolate whereas this one tastes like a delicious smore. This is my favorite flavor of all time!!
4_bj,2018-09-27,5,AMAZING - my new all time FAVORITE!!,"I tried this knowing how good the old one was, but this is even better! I actually stopped buying the old one since it got too sweet and overpowering for me, and this newer version fires on all cylinders for me. My 11 year old son also loves it so we have stocked the freezer ;)"
4_bj,2018-09-10,5,I hate that this is limited,"My Husband and I enjoy Ben & Jerrys ice cream a few times a week. We have our ""usual"" flavors; Cherry Garcia and Pistachio. We tried this a couple weeks ago and we LOVED it - the marshmellowy icecream and the crunchy bits plus chocolate pcs perfectly delicious. Now we need MORE"
4_bj,2018-09-27,5,I can’t stop buying this.,I never had a favorite flavor of ice cream... until now. I’m terrified of the fact that it is Limited Batch. I keep buying a couple of pints when I’m at the grocery store. They go quickly at my house. And so far they are still in stock... but I’m afraid! Don’t take it away!
4_bj,2018-07-15,5,BEST FLAVOR EVER,Honestly I don't know how this flavor only has four stars because it is legitimately one of the best (if not the best) Ben and Jerry's flavors of all time. SOOOO good.
4_bj,2019-01-12,4,Great Flavor,Wonderful remic to the prior version. I really love the chocolate cookie swirl in this. I really wish there was a pronounced graham cracker in here. Maybe replacing the dark chocolate chip with a cluster of graham cracker instead would probably make this a better flavor IMO
4_bj,2019-01-08,5,EVERYTHING I'VE EVER WANTED,"Gimme S'more! is one of the best flavors Ben & Jerry's make.
The Marsh mellow is sweet without being too sweet. Great ratio between Chocolate Swirls & Flakes and Graham Cracker Swirl. Although I wish there was MORE Graham Cracker Swirl because it's so tasty and crunchy."
4_bj,2018-04-29,5,So Good,I picked this up yesterday and I wasn't sure that I would like it because I tend to be pretty simple in my ice cream tastes. I am so excited that I did because this is delicious! My favorite part is the combination of the ice cream flavor and the graham cracker swirls.
4_bj,2018-06-05,5,Best flavor yet!,Best flavor yet! Cant seem to find more in the same stores lately!
4_bj,2018-09-09,1,Gimme smores,The old version is much better this one is not very good at all.
4_bj,2018-04-13,5,Best flavor ever,This is the best Ben and Jerry’s I’ve ever tried. It’s amazing!
4_bj,2018-04-19,5,All gone!,Finished a pint in one sitting it's just sooooo good!
4_bj,2020-04-26,5,Great smores flavor,Bought one of each of the new flavors and this was the first i tried. Its great taste like smores and id buy again. However BRING BACK VANILLA HEATH BAR CRUNCH PLEASE!!!! Obviously i dont eat this for breakfast lunch or dinner either thats a stupid question
4_bj,2018-08-26,5,All time favorite icecream,I have an obsession. I live around the Algonac mi area. And I guarantee your sells for the gimme s’mores are up thanks to I. I can’t help but eat it on the daily. Absolute best icecream I’ve ever had. I hope it becomes permanent. I’ll be sad to see it go.
4_bj,2019-01-29,5,LOVE IT!!!,"I love Ben & Jerry's and I have tried many different flavors. However, this one is definitely my favorite! I've lost count of how many pints I have bought so far. I hope you guys decide to keep this flavor, I was disappointed that it said ""Limited Batch""."
4_bj,2018-10-09,5,Best flavor ever!,"Please keep this flavor forever, this might be my new all time favorite. Perfect for s'mores lovers, blows the other s'mores flavor out of the water. Love the graham cracker/cookie trails and the toasted marshmallow flavor. It's simply the perfect pint."
4_bj,2019-06-26,5,The most delicious flavor ever probably,Do yourself a favor and try it! Its delicious. The roasted marshmallow ice cream with graham cracker swirls is just a great mix with the chocolate cookie. I made the mistake of confusing is Gimme S'more! for S'more and while it's good it's not as good.
4_bj,2018-08-30,5,BEST ICE CREAM EVER!!,This is my favorite ice cream by far from anything in store or even fresh from our local ice cream shops! I can’t live without it! I even like it better than the regular s’mores flavor by Ben and Jerry’s. Please please make this a permanent flavor!!!!
4_bj,2019-01-28,5,Absolute Favorite!,"This is hands-down the best flavor Ben and Jerry’s has ever made! I love all ice cream but this was so delicious. Tons of graham cracker, chocolate chunks, and chocolate swirl throughout. I wish this was made all year long! I highly recommend this."
4_bj,2018-09-19,5,Best Ben and Jerry’s flavor,"My husband and I have purchased this flavor multiple times this summer. By far, one of the best flavors and would love it if it became a permanent option. The combination of ingredients is phenomenal, you won’t regret choosing this flavored pint."
4_bj,2018-12-10,5,This is my favorite flavor,"Please add this add as permanent flavor!!! Tried this on a whim and its taken over as the only flavor I have in my freezer. I usually have great self control and eat only a little at time, but with this flavor I can't help but eat the whole pint."
4_bj,2018-10-28,5,BEST FLAVOR EVER,Bought this a month ago & went back for it & have not been able to find it since & am DEVASTATED! It is the BEST icecream I've EVER had & I am pretty picky...like about everything. It has a well balanced flavor that tastes LITERALLY like smores
4_bj,2018-09-14,5,PLEASE MAKE PERMANENT!!!!!,This is literally THE best ice cream I have EVER tasted. I would love nothing more than for it to be permanent. I have bought every single pint at the three grocery stores in my town! I could not have asked for a more perfect flavor combo.
4_bj,2018-08-07,5,Surprising combo,"The Gram cracker and chocolate cookie swirls go amazing with the toasted marshmallow ice cream. The fudge flakes add a nice crunch to the texture. Amazing combo of light and rich flavors, def my new favorite. A bit hard to find in stores."
4_bj,2019-06-04,5,Best of the best!,This is easily the best flavor Ben and Jerry’s has ever released. I firmly believe it should replace the original s’mores because gimme s’mores blows it out of the water. It seems like it’s gone but I’m always on the hunt for it nonetheless
4_bj,2018-04-12,5,One of the best!,I bought this one after the store was out of my usual and I give it 10 stars it was perfect! I usual have to pick a flavor that doesn’t have too much hard crunch because of sensitive teeth and this hit the nail on the head! Will buy again!
4_bj,2019-05-20,5,BEST FLAVOR EVER!!,"This flavor should become a permanent flavor. Way better then the OG S'mores. I was so sad when my grocery store ran out of this Gimme S'more. Please mamke more of this delicious flavor and make it a permanent one, available all the time!!"
4_bj,2020-09-14,4,Almost perfect!,i tried it today and it was SO good!! the only thing that would make it better is if the ice cream itself had more of a toasted marshmallow taste. i think right now it just tastes like vanilla (maybe just a tiny bit sweeter tho).
4_bj,2018-11-14,5,My absolute favorite flavor!!,"This is the best flavor, I’m obsessed with it. I have to have at least two pints in my freezer at all times! I know it’s limited edition, but PLEASE keep it!! It’s even topping half baked and mint chocolate cookie as my favorite!"
4_bj,2018-10-04,4,"Great taste, but not a staple favorite","I absolutely love this flavor, all of the flavors stand out on their own but blend well together. I definitely would grab this on occasion when available. But due to lack of availability it just hasn't become a staple favorite."
4_bj,2018-04-28,5,New Favorite Flavor!!!,This is by far the best Smore's flavored ice cream. Do yourself a favor and try this out because you will NOT be disappointed!
4_bj,2019-08-12,5,Waiting for the return,This is a limited edition batch - but it shouldn't be. It's been months since I last found this in stores and I'm waiting for it's return. PLEASE MAKE THIS A PERMANENT FLAVOR. This is some much better than the OG Smore flavor.
4_bj,2020-03-27,5,Favorite Flavor!,"Hey guys!
This is my absolute favorite flavor and I am so thankful it is back! I don't eat chocolate ice cream so this version of S'mores is perfect with a marshmallow based ice cream instead of the chocolate based ice cream!"
4_bj,2019-01-23,5,The BEST!,The best Ben & Jerry's flavor yet. AWESOME! Hope this one becomes a regular flavor. I ended up buying the four pints that my local grocery store had left and placed in my deep freeze. So much better than the S'more flavor.
4_bj,2019-01-08,5,My new favorite!,Tried this when it first came out and I was hooked. It has become my new favorite and I like it a lot better than the original S’mores. Hopefully they make this a regular flavor as I’m sad it’s becoming harder to find.
4_bj,2018-09-15,5,AMAZING FLAVOR,This is probably the best Ben & Jerry's ice cream I've ever had. My boyfriend and I are obsessed with it. We want it to be a permanent flavor not just limited batch!!! It it so so yummy- please keep it forever B&J!!!!
4_bj,2020-04-23,5,Best flavor yet,S'mores is one of my favorite flavors ever and B&J's absolutely killed it. You taste the cookies more than anything but once you get to the marshmallow and graham cracker tastes it is amazing. Would highly recommend.
4_bj,2020-08-11,5,This sold me on Marshmallow,I have never been a fan of marshmallow anything. The exception...Smores over the campfire. This ice cream flavor has me hooked. The marshmallow is subtle but pairs well with the graham cracker and chunky fudgy bits.
4_bj,2018-04-01,5,Almost Perfect!,I LOVE S'more flavored things and all existing ice creams on the market do not have a good take on it. Ben and Jerry's S'more ice cream is so addicting! Add a bit more graham cracker and perfection will be reached!
4_bj,2018-08-08,5,Soooo good,"Every part of this flavor is amazing. The toasted marshmallow ice cream would be good enough on its own, but throw in the graham cracker swirls and chocolate and it's one of the best desserts you can buy frozen"
4_bj,2020-05-29,5,Suprise!,"This flavor was surprisingly DELICIOUS!!!! I was hesitant that the marshmallow would be too sweet but it was such a nice flavor, actually more like a cheesecake taste. Definitely will be getting this again!"
4_bj,2018-05-21,5,So unique!,"The marshmallow flavor was very unique! For a s’mores ice cream, I was surprised but happily! I’m usually a chocolate therapy girl, but this may be a new fave! There were plenty of toppings in every bite!"
4_bj,2018-12-08,5,100% New Favorite Flavor - PLEASE KEEP IT!,"Its like comfort in a pint. Always been a hug fan of Phish Food, but this one is nostalgic and DELICIOUS. I know it’s a limted batch, but I would LOVE to see this on the permanent Ben & Jerry’s lineup!"
4_bj,2018-09-30,5,ARE U KIDDING ME,"Guys, I have eaten a ton of Ben and Jerry in my lifetime but THIS is the best I have ever had. Let’s stop the games and make it a permanent flavor. Once this limited batch is done, I’ll be heartbroken."
4_bj,2019-01-13,5,Favorite Ice Cream Ever!,"This is my favorite flavor of Ben & Jerry’s, & my favorite ice cream flavor I’ve tried. I like anything inspired by s’mores, and this ice cream did not dissapoint. I hope they keep this flavor around!"
4_bj,2020-06-23,3,Smores Flavor is better,"I was not a fan of the toasted marshmallow Ice Cream. the chocolate cookie swirls, graham cracker swirls and fudge flakes are all wonderful fill ins. I wish they used a different tasting marshmallow"
4_bj,2018-12-19,5,BY FAR BEST BEN & JERRYS FLAVOR,This is by far the best Ben & Jerry's flavor ever. Finally a s'mores flavor that realizes chocolate is not the star in a s'mores its the GRAHAM CRACKERS. PLEASE make this a permanent flavor!!!!!!!!
4_bj,2018-06-27,5,PLEASE DON'T LESS THIS BE LIMITED,"This may be my new favorite flavor!! I seriously hope they keep this on forever as a flavor since it said limited batch. I didn't think I could like one more than Half Baked, but this may beat it"
4_bj,2018-12-13,1,Very disappointing.,"I couldn't find the traditional ""S'mores"" flavor at the grocery store so, as a smores fan, I bought this one instead. What a disappointment! I literally took one bite and made a face because I did not like the flavor. I dug around for a minute looking for a marshmallow swirl.... nope, it's not there. Just small bits of chocolate cookie. What? How is this a smores ice cream? The base ice cream tastes nothing like marshmallow and certainly doesn't have the wonderful marshmallow texture the old ice cream had. Couldn't find anything resembling graham cracker here either, unlike the old one. This is just.... cookies and cream. And a pretty dull cookies and cream at that. This is not only nothing like smores, it is a dull ice cream."
4_bj,2018-07-08,5,Amazing,I originally bought a pint of this flavor two weeks ago. We finished the first pint so fast that now we buy two every time we stock up on ice cream. I can’t wait to get s’more of this flavor.
4_bj,2020-02-06,5,Best Icecream I've Ever Tasted,I'm so excited to see they're bringing this flavor back. It's been gone for about two years and I thought I'd never get my ice cream back. Thank you Ben and Jerry's for answering my prayers.
4_bj,2018-06-29,5,Amazing Ice Cream,I love anything marshmallow and this ice cream hits the spot! I was so excited to try this and I'm so happy I did! Going to be stocking up since it's a limited edition flavor! Amazing!
4_bj,2018-06-30,5,My new favorite,I love this new flavor. I hope it sticks around. I love s'mores flavored things. This just adds to the list of delicious s'mores like treats. Perfect blend of flavors. I love it!
4_bj,2020-03-28,5,One of the best flavors,"I have not tried all Ben and Jerry flavors, but have tried enough to rate this as one of the best. The hint of toasted marshmallow with chocolate and graham cracker are spot on."
4_bj,2018-07-22,5,Holy s’mores!!,I’ve never made a review for any ice cream but this one deserves it!! Never been so disappointed about something being limited edition. This is my ultimate favorite ice cream.
4_bj,2018-07-13,5,The chocolate cookie swirl... Oh my!!,"By far my favorite B&J yet. The ingredients yall use is what makes the difference. That was the only one left at our Target so I hope that get more. I’m in LOVE! -Oxford, AL."
4_bj,2020-05-22,5,Amazing taste!!,Every time I go to a food store I always get gimmie smore!It has a amazing taste!!If you like chocolate chunks and graham crackers and marshmallows the your in for a treat!!
4_bj,2018-11-17,5,My new favorite flavor,"Excellent balance of chocolate to graham cracker. Could use more of a toasty note on the marshmallow, but favorite new flavor along with with the oat of this swirled flavor."
4_bj,2020-08-18,1,They forgot the s'more!,"Terrible. s'mores are graham crackers, marshallow, chocolate. Gimme S'more has ZERO graham cracker taste. It's essentially just another vanilla ice cream with chocolate."
4_bj,2018-07-10,5,Life changing,"This might be my new favorite. The taste and texture are amazing. The crunch of the graham cracker, chocolate swirls. I told my sister I would share, but there was no way."
4_bj,2018-10-22,5,YUM,This flavor is so amazing. i’m a huge s’mores person and i couldn’t believe how amazing this was. B&J is my go to ice cream and i’ve offically found my go to flavor. YUM!
4_bj,2020-02-18,5,So glad it’s back!!,This ice cream is so delicious when my wife found out it was back for good she was smiled bigger than on our wedding day. Such an improvement from the old s’mores flavor!
4_bj,2020-06-19,2,Good but flavor not as advertised.,I was so excited to try this but the toasted marshmallow ice cream does not taste anything like marshmallows or any kind of toasted flavor. It’s more like regular cream.
4_bj,2018-08-01,5,So Good!,"This was so good! I'm not a fan of the chocolate based s'mores and really enjoyed the sweet cream base here. I do wish they had more graham cracker swirls, though."
4_bj,2018-08-14,5,Love it but..,"Everytime I find a flavor I love either they discontinue it or it becomes hard to find in my area...this is my new favorite flavor, please don't make me regret it!!"
4_bj,2018-05-26,5,New favorite flavor!,Just found this. Tried it and it's my favorite flavor. I bought all of them at my local store. I love how much graham crackers crumbs are in it. Soooooo delicious!
4_bj,2018-10-11,5,New favorite flavor!!!,This is the best flavor ice cream I have ever had. I will be heartbroken when I can no longer find it on the shelves. Please bring the flavor back next summer!!!!!
4_bj,2018-08-22,5,Delicious!,I am going to be heartbroken when I don't see this is the stores anymore. I am obsessed. I always buy this when at the grocery store...and usually more than one.
4_bj,2018-06-21,5,Needs one thing,"If we can buy Americone Dream with Stephen Colbert, and The Tonight Dough with Jimmy Fallon, I feel like we should definitely have Busta Rhymes on Gimme S’more!"
4_bj,2018-07-30,4,Good but no marshmallow flavor,This was good ice cream but I didn't get the smores flavor. I wasn't getting any marshmallow. If it was stronger it would be perfect. But it was good to eat!
4_bj,2019-01-08,5,Oh my delicious,Hands down the best ice cream I’ll ever have. I stock up all summer just to make sure I’ll have enough to get me through all other seasons... it’s THAT good.
4_bj,2018-10-20,5,Best ice cream ever!,I don’t ever write reviews but this is the best ice cream I have ever eaten. I really hope this becomes a standard year round flavor I could eat it everyday.
4_bj,2018-09-13,5,Gimme S'more Permanently!,"The cookie and graham cracker swirls are my favorite part and this is my favorite flavor by far! It's not too sickly sweet, but satisfied your sweet tooth!"
4_bj,2018-05-20,4,I’ll take S’more,"I really like this flavor, the combination works really well. I dont think it tastes as close to a s’more as the original flavor, but still a solid pint."
4_bj,2018-05-03,5,I’m in love,I really enjoy my ice cream so when I saw this flavor I had to try it! Needless to say it’s my go to now! Please consider keeping this flavor permanently!
4_bj,2018-05-17,5,Love This Flavor,The marshmallow ice cream blends perfectly with the graham crackers and fudge swirls. A perfect amount of everything a a very great and spot on base!
4_bj,2019-02-24,5,My favorite!,"I tried this flavor not too long ago expanding from my usual half baked, this has now moved into spot #1. Please please make this a full time flavor!"
4_bj,2019-02-05,5,Daggone Right! Gimme S'more....,"#THIS by far is my FAVE-O-RIT B&Js flavor.... I thought Urban Bourban was hitting on something, but #THIS.... Gimme S'more for sure! mmmmmmmmmmmmm"
4_bj,2019-06-17,5,Yes!,"Marshmallow ice cream is a refreshing twist on the usual chocolate ice cream base. This is a new favorite, and I always grab a pint when I see one!"
4_bj,2019-07-08,5,The best flavor,I pray this becomes a permanent flavor.. When I tell you I searched EVERYWHERE for this when it was a limited edition flavor... PLEASE BRING IT BACK
4_bj,2018-07-22,5,On Point,It's a tie with Americone dream for my favorite. The chocolate cookies are a good alternative for chocolate chunks and make it a little lighter.
4_bj,2019-07-24,5,Please bring it back,"Please bring it back, best flavor you guys have made, been to Vermont multiple times, and go to the local store regularly. Please bring it back."
4_bj,2020-04-11,2,More like Gimme Something else,I thought I was grabbing a personal favorite. The s’mores ice cream and ended up with this disappointment. I’ll pay more attention next time.
4_bj,2018-05-13,5,Best Flavor I have ever had!,I tried this on our tour of the plant in vermont and now that its out I have been getting it as much as possible before It goes away forever.
4_bj,2019-03-13,5,Make this a regular!,"My favorite flavor ever. Please remove this from the "" limited batch"" category and make it a regular item please. It's so difficult to get!"
4_bj,2018-07-23,5,Holy amazing!,"We bought this flavor once and now cannot stop buying it. We officially have “a problem”, haha. The marshmallow ice cream is incredible!"
4_bj,2018-05-24,5,wish it wasn't limited!,Excellent flavor. Tastes like a french vanilla based ice cream but even better with all the mix ins. I want this to be a regular flavor!
4_bj,2018-09-09,5,Please keep this all year-round,"This was the best S'mores ice cream I have ever had. It saddens me to see it as a ""limited batch"" flavor as if it will be gone one day."
4_bj,2018-08-30,5,Best flavor out there! Please don't discontinue,I was heartbroken when B&Js discontinued Imagine Whirled Peace - this is the best thing that has come out since then. Please keep it!
4_bj,2018-12-06,5,Best Ice Cream Ever,This flavor is the best Ben and Jerry have ever come out with. It is a perfect combination of flavors! I hope they keep it around!
4_bj,2019-01-08,5,Great taste,I buy/bought this very frequently. Few times a week. So much better than the original. Needs to be available all the time.
4_bj,2018-09-29,5,So amazing,Everytime I see this kind I buy as many as I can please please keep it And the best part is the cookie swirl it is heaven
4_bj,2018-06-26,5,MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE ICE CREAM,"Never, ever get rid of this flavor. I didn't think anything would knock Phish Food off the top of my list. This one did."
4_bj,2020-02-25,1,Not S'mores,The old S'mores was the best flavor. Cookie chunks? Not like a s'mores. The ice cream taste is way off. Very unhappy.
4_bj,2018-08-16,5,Just Wow. Feels like I'm sitting at a Camp fire,My new favorite ice cream in the world. Cant believe you guys figured out how to make a toasted marshmallow ice cream
4_bj,2018-05-10,5,A MUST KEEP FLAVOR,This is the BEST flavor I’ve ever had. It needs to stay as a permanent flavor it’s the best!!! You can’t put it down!
4_bj,2019-03-22,5,Bruh,You gotta bring this back! It is my favorite thing and my life hasn´t been the same since I´ve tasted it. Please.
4_bj,2020-05-29,2,Doesn’t come close to the other S’mores,Disappointing. Doesn’t taste like s’mores. Their other S’mores offering with the chocolate ice cream is the BEST
4_bj,2018-09-26,5,Best Ice Cream I’ve Ever Had,This truly is euphoria in a bowl. I like to put chocolate syrup on mine. I wish this flavor was at more stores!
4_bj,2020-07-21,5,NEVER GET RID OF THIS,"this is by far my FAVORITE Ben and Jerry hands down, I buy every one I see!! A must try for s’mores lovers !!!"
4_bj,2018-06-30,5,The Best Flavor Ever!,My boyfriend and I bought every container from the store! (6 pints) (It didn’t last as long as we expected)
4_bj,2018-05-16,5,Amazing!!!!!!!,Our whole family is crazy about this flavor! It is the best! Please don’t stop making it… Ever. Ever. EVER
4_bj,2019-05-18,5,The best smores,This is the best flavor. The chocolate ice cream of the other smores is just too much. This one is perfect
4_bj,2018-07-16,5,Love it!,Not chocolate-heavy like the other S'mores flavor. Nice graham cracker flavor and texture. Well-balanced.
4_bj,2018-09-01,5,Delicious!,Love this flavor! Please make it one of the regulars. It has the perfect balance and tastes so delicious!
4_bj,2018-08-14,5,Please keep making it,I am in love with this flavor! I am so sad to know it is only limited batch. Please don’t discontinue it.
4_bj,2019-01-13,5,Don’t Get Rid of This!,This is so good that I desperately try to find it in the city sometimes. Please don’t get rid of it!!!
4_bj,2020-03-10,5,Is it possible to give 10 stars?,I was sooooooo happy when you brought this flavor back from Limited Batch status. I could live on it.
4_bj,2018-12-09,5,My new favorite!,"Please replace this one for the current s’mores! This flavor is so delicious, I can’t get enough!!"
4_bj,2020-07-03,5,Amazing Ice Cream!!!,I recently bought this and I am very impressed. It was very good and I would definitely recommend!
4_bj,2018-11-14,5,Best flavor,My favorite used to be Phish Food. Gimme S'more is even better! This should be a permanent flavor.
4_bj,2018-12-05,5,Please Keep this flavor,This flavor is amazing and it said it was a limited batch. Please keep it as a permanent flavor.
4_bj,2019-02-02,5,Please keep this forever!!!,0h my yummm!! This by far is my favorite & my new weakness! Ben & jerry please keep this one!!!
4_bj,2020-04-16,5,Favorite!,I honestly think this is one of my favorite flavors of Ben&Jerry's! Perfect texture and crunch
4_bj,2020-06-10,5,Incredible flavor!!,Hands down my all time favorite ice cream! I will buy this for as long as I shall live lol!
4_bj,2019-06-10,5,Favorite B&J Flavor!,This pint has the perfect amount of add-ins that it's not too overwhelming. Perfect combo
4_bj,2019-01-29,5,Awesome,"Super delicious, definitely my favorite flavor. I really hope it becomes permanent."
4_bj,2018-10-14,5,Amazing. Simply amazing.,"I've been eating Ben & Jerry's for 15 years, and this is easily my favorite flavor."
4_bj,2019-07-01,5,Please keep as a flavor that is always available!,"Perfection if you love s’mores, especially if the marshmallows are your favorite"
4_bj,2020-06-04,5,Soooo Good !,"Thrilled they brought this flavor back !
I could eat pint after pint of this"
4_bj,2020-08-22,5,Love,My all time favorite flavor. I hate that it’s seasonal. I want it year round!
4_bj,2019-01-21,5,Just amazing,Tried about a month ago and am hooked only downfall not a year round flavor.
4_bj,2020-03-21,5,One of the best!,This is one of the best B&J I have ever had. Please keep this one around.
4_bj,2020-06-01,5,AMAZING!,this is my absolute favorite ice cream flavor ive ever had. so so so good.
4_bj,2019-01-19,5,Favorite flavor to share,This is the only flavor we agree on. The graham cracker is the best part!
4_bj,2018-10-30,5,Simply Amazing,Havent had anything else the past few months. This flavor is pure gold.
4_bj,2018-10-14,5,Awesome,"Please keep it. Also miss the caramel one, the good ones need to stay"
4_bj,2019-04-28,5,Buy,I don't know why this is limited batch it is the best flavor to date.
4_bj,2018-11-04,5,BEST Flavor EVER. Please add more Marshmallows,Amazon just AMAZING. i bought 7 in one week! Please keep it coming
4_bj,2020-08-13,5,My new favorite!,I love a good s’more and this ice cream is perfect and I love it!
4_bj,2019-05-03,5,Best flavor!,This is my new flavor & far exceeds the chocolate S’more version!
4_bj,2020-06-30,5,Best Flavor Hands Down!,Delicious! This is by far my favorite B&J flavor of all!
4_bj,2020-07-03,5,New favorite!,Definitely one of my new favorite flavors. Too good!!
4_bj,2020-06-28,5,THE CHEF’S KISS,The flavor is IMMACULATE. I mean... need I say more?
4_bj,2019-01-28,5,Amazing!,Best ice cream ever! Please make it permanent!!!!!!
5_bj,2020-02-26,5,Peanut Butter makes everything better,"A flavor I'm glad to see back after liking it before it was discontinued, PB Half Baked is even better than I remembered. There's not much to say if youve already had the standard half baked. It works very similarly except that the vanilla portion of the flavor is now replaced with peanut butter ice cream, and the chocolate chip cookie dough is instead peanut butter cookie dough. For such slight changes though, they do make a big difference. One thing I disliked in the original half baked was how weak the vanilla base was and how it was completely dominated by the chocolate. That's not the case here as the peanut butter taste to the ice cream is strong enough to balance out the chocolate, giving the classic combination we know and love. The balance is also matched perfectly with the mix ins. There are HUGE brownie squares in this flavor, tasting great as always, and combined with the numerous peanut butter cookie dough pieces, you're getting the chocolate/peanut butter taste in every bite. If you're a fan of that flavor combination, you can't go wrong with Peanut Butter Half Baked."
5_bj,2020-04-07,5,Best flavor EVER,Normally the tonight dough is my go to. I have been waiting for this flavor to get to my area and went it finally did I made sure run right to the store. I was in LOVE after the first bite . This is by far the best peanut butter ice cream flavor ever made. I beg and plead for this flavor to never go away because I am forever hooked. Thank you thank you thank you for my new favorite ever. This is a MUST TRY because you won’t look back
5_bj,2020-07-03,5,Omg so delish!,"I bought this at a Ben & Jerry’s store a couple days ago in Sandbridge, VA and it was oh so good! I am a sucker for anything chocolate and peanut butter and this did not disappoint. My son took one lick and was jealous he did not pick it so we went back again last night and bought some for him! I love the peanut butter ice cream and fudge brownie and didn’t realize the cookie dough is peanut butter too, yum! Now that I am home from vacation I just need to find it near where I live!"
5_bj,2020-08-01,5,THANK YOU!!!!!!,First of all I would like to say THANK YOU to whoever decided to put peanut butter in half baked! Half Baked is my favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor but I'm not a huge fan of vanilla ice cream... I just think the Peanut Butter ice cream really pairs well with the rest of the components in this mix. Dare I say... I might like this BETTER than the original Half Baked? It's too soon to tell. I love you Ben & Jerry!
5_bj,2020-06-03,5,Many problems fixed!,"The ice cream has chunky brownie, amazing cookie dough... Just amazing stuff!"
5_bj,2020-04-22,5,Quarantine Dream,"It’s everything you could wish for that would make being stuck at home seem a real treat. Chunks abound! The peanut butter and chocolate combination is hearty, decadent and worth it!"
5_bj,2020-04-22,5,Yes.,Yes. Just yes. Nothing else needs to be said. This ice cream is it. Buy it. Try it. Love it.
5_bj,2020-09-08,5,Beessst Ice Cream Flavor!!,"I LOVE this flavor, and I am happy it is now a full time flavor! Both my mom and I find this as our go-to desert. The ice cream is loaded with stuff: cookie dough and brownies and on the side I like to add in some chopped nuts. LOVE LOVE LOVE."
5_bj,2020-06-12,4,"Love the PB, just needs a little more","Bought this past week, was expecting a lot more PB, was very similar to the regular Half Baked. Still Very Good!"
5_bj,2020-07-02,5,my new favorite,"If you like peanut butter cup or PB and chocolate, this is like that, but so much better"
5_bj,2020-09-09,5,Best ice cream in the world,"If Ben and Jerry’s only made one flavor, I’d want it to be peanut butter half baked."
5_bj,2020-06-13,5,Ice Cream Dreams Fullfilled,Took me awhile to find this but when I did I just kept going back for more.
5_bj,2020-06-16,5,My wife and I’s Favorite!,The perfect combination all in one! And the better “half” to half baked
5_bj,2020-04-09,5,It's back and the best!,So bummed when this disappeared. Our voices were heard! Thanks guys!
6_bj,2020-04-24,5,Berry good!,"All time favorite flavor! The berry flavored swirls of ice cream are perfectly delicately, but distinctly, flavored. The natural pastel purple that comes from the blackberries is definitely an adorable plus! The mascarpone ice cream swirls have that heavenly cheesecake-y taste, which combines with the soft crumbly shortbread to create a tiramisu-esque experience... but instead of the rich notes coming from cinnamon it comes from the crunchy fudge-covered almonds. May I suggest renaming this flavor to ""Chuck Berry Mascarpone"" after Chuck Berry: one of the pioneers of rock'n'roll."
6_bj,2020-07-30,5,Seriously The Best Ice Cream Ever,"This is without a doubt the best ice cream I have ever tried from Ben and Jerry's, and probably from anywhere at all! There is a B&J's scoop shop down the street from my apartment, one a couple miles away, and countless grocery stores in between. However, I constantly find myself driving out of the way to go to the only store in the area that I know stocks this flavor regularly. It is the perfect combination of flavors, and I have a really hard time keeping myself from going through the whole pint in one quick sitting. I will be absolutely devastated when this exclusive flavor is no longer available. Please keep it as a regular!!"
6_bj,2020-05-21,5,Excellent,"A lot of recent flavors from Ben and Jerry's have left me disappointed but I saw this at Whole Foods and had to give it a go, because I'm like a Ben and Jerry's expert at this point. I thought it was going to be gross but I was pleasantly surprised by how all the flavors complimented each other. I left a few other people in the house have a small spoonful and they liked it as well. And to the person who said Strawberry Cheesecake is gone, you are wrong. That flavor is everywhere and never going away. Perhaps your store just stopped carrying it. It would be nice if they brought back the Blueberry Cheesecake flavor that was an exclusive at Walmart years ago. Anyway, Blackberry ice cream gets thumbs up from me!"
6_bj,2020-08-09,5,Love this!,This is my new favorite ice cream!!! It is absolutely delicious! I saw this at my local Whole Foods and decided to give it a try since I was craving ice cream with berries and I was so pleased when I got home and tried it. This flavor has just the right amount of sweetness and the flavor combo is to die for. The chocolate covered almonds and cookie bits not only add to the flavors but provide a great texture. I usually don't write reviews but this is so good and I'm afraid it will only be a limited time product. I hope they keep this one. I'll buy it forever. Recommending to all my family and friends.
6_bj,2020-05-20,5,Sooooo good!,"I’m not even a big ice cream fan, but this is life changing!"
6_bj,2020-07-08,5,my absolute favorite now!,"first of all--the pieces of cookie throughout the ice cream are EVERYTHING! I love the balance of flavors. It's so good. I'm actively searching for it which is the primary reason I ended up on this website, but figured I'd add a review and give it 5 stars to keep it on shelves."
6_bj,2020-07-26,5,My new favorite flavor!,"This is a great balance of flavors -- each one compliments the other and none of them are too over powering. Creamy, sweet, and a little fruity. I especially like that's it not jam packed with fixings and you get to taste the actual ice cream."
6_bj,2020-07-22,5,Top 5,Great flavor combination. I wanted to try it because it was a new flavor and ended up loving it! Definitely in my top 5. My only criticism is that is it difficult to obtain.
6_bj,2020-09-23,5,Swept off my feet,"When I bought this flavor, I was hesitant to switch things up from my trusty flavor, The Tonight Dough. At night, I got peckish and searched the fridge until I remembered about this new flavor. I was in bed when I had my first bite, my only main regret."
6_bj,2020-05-13,1,Nope,Bring Bach strawberry cheesecake. This isn't cutting it!!! I'm done buying Ben and Jerry's until it comes back!!!!
7_bj,2020-03-31,5,fav Flavor !!,"This is my Favorite Ben & Jerrys Flavor ever, I wish it was easier to find. so many pB cups !! #LOVE that !! I really hope they make it permanent, because their is not very many other options for banana lovers. (I Hate the toppings in Chunky Monkey (◕︿◕✿)) would love if they added fudge brownies"
7_bj,2020-06-03,5,Best Flavor Combo!,"I'm so glad this flavor exists, it's my new favorite! Chocolate, PB, and banana is such a good combo, I order smoothies and milkshakes in that combo too."
7_bj,2020-03-02,5,Yum!,It’s like chunky monkey but with peanut butter cups instead of nuts!
7_bj,2020-06-11,5,Best B&J Ever!,This is the best Ben & Jerry's I've ever had! I can no longer eat nuts so the peanut butter cups are the best alternative to Chubby Hubby. I hope this flavor is available forever!
7_bj,2020-05-11,5,Best flavor!,Bought this on a whim and it's the best B&J flavor of them all.
7_bj,2020-07-02,5,My absolute favorite,"My local store sold out completely of this flavor, no word when it’s coming back. :( I love it. The banana so good. It’s the better version of chunky monkey! The cups are perfect!"
7_bj,2020-08-01,5,Best ever!,"This is the best flavor Ben and Jerry’s has done!
Banana and chocolate ice cream with mini peanut butter cups. Please please keep this as a permanent flavor. I buy multiple containers whenever I can find it!!"
8_bj,2019-09-30,5,This needs to be a REGULAR flavor!,"Happened upon this at the grocery store, and knew I needed to get it. I've been enjoying Jen & Jerry's for decades, and my favorites before this were Cherry Garcia, Apple Pie a la Mode (from years ago - I heard this one couldn't be added to the reg. menu because the price of apples fluctuates too much), Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, then Half-Baked, and more recently Cinnamon Buns. This one combines SO MANY of my favorites: cinnamon, dough, chocolate, brownies ... and now SPICE. YAS. I LOVE spiced and spicy chocolate, and what has been created here with this special edition is just EVERYTHING. PLEASE keep *churning* this one out!!! ;D It is simply the BEST."
8_bj,2019-12-14,5,Best Flavor! Please Add Permanently!’,I have been hooked on half baked for years now but this flavor changed everything! There’s just so much depth of flavor. I thought the spicy brownie would be too much but it’s very mild. I’d still prefer normal brownie but not by much. I love that the cinnamon ice cream and chocolate ice cream are two different ice creams swirled together. At first glance I thought it was going to be just chocolate ice cream with cinnamon flavor but I was wrong. Every bite is a unique balance of flavor that sends my tastebuds to heaven. I just wish it wasn’t a limited batch. I can’t go back to just half baked after this.
8_bj,2019-11-01,4,Sooooo close!,"I really enjoyed this flavor--interesting, but not so far out there that I couldn't wrap my taste buds around it (I was a bit skeptical about the spice factor, but it was nice and mild). However, while the pint succeeded in taste, it fell short on execution (bad pun unintended, considering the name). The chocolate base was noticeably less dense than the cinnamon, and was riddled with tiny air bubbles. It still tasted great, but the creaminess was inconsistent, and likewise, there were plenty of dough gobs but only 3 big brownie chunks. Seems like Justice Remix'd just needed a a bit more balanced mixing.
For reference, my pint's info: UPC 076840036745, Date FEB0621BJ52, 5095 09:20 67834702)"
8_bj,2019-09-23,5,Keep this flavor! PLEASE!!!,"I bought this flavor today. Upon trying it, I immediately wanted to go back to the store & buy every pint that they had. SOOO GOOOD!!! Please keep this as a permanent flavor, instead of a limited batch. This is one of the best flavors you've designed in a long time (except for the sour sorbet this summer)."
8_bj,2019-10-03,5,Please keep forever,"Oh man. I don't even seek out ice cream that often, but this flavor caught my eye and now I am an absolute fiend for it. I'm getting emotional thinking about this ice cream. I tell everyone I know to please try this ice cream. I sent out text messages to my family telling them to go buy this ice cream. I have never tasted anything like it in my life! Please keep it forever! I'm obsessed! (And of course I am also happy to hear about the nonprofit partnership.)"
8_bj,2019-09-16,5,Tastes like Abuelita hot chocolate!,"This is delicious. I didn't know what to expect when I read the description of the flavor, but OMG it's so good. It takes like the Abuelita brand hot chocolate with a little hint of spice from the brownies. I love it!"
8_bj,2019-10-16,5,Best one so far!,I was a little nervous about the spicy brownies but oh my gosh! I love this flavor!! Please be a regular flavor not a limited batch!!! It’s so good!!!
8_bj,2019-10-01,5,Possibly your greatest flavor ever.,"This hit every sweet spot for me. I'm serious. Absolutley loved this flavor, and I'm actually a little sad I tried it, because if it's a limited edition flavor that means it'll go away and never return. This needs a spot in the regular rotation. Don't make me go back to the store and hoard all of them."
8_bj,2020-02-02,5,Best Ice Cream so far!,"I love cinnamon more than any other flavour in general (in cakes, bubble gum, tequilla, porridge ... - you see, ice cream is certainly no exception), so i was really excited to try the ben & jerry's cinnamon bun, when I saw that flavour for the first time some years ago. Unfortunately, when it comes to ice cream, I strongly prefer chocolate over vanilla or caramel as a base, so I the cinnamon bun flavour didn't blow my mind completelly. Just 1 hour ago I saw THIS new flavour at a gas station and coudn't resist. It's even better than I expected, because the spiciness harmonize so well with the cinnamon & chocolate (that I always love). So I highly recommend this ice cream flavour to anyone, who really loves cinnamon in general and chocolate ice cream."
8_bj,2019-11-25,5,The spicy fudge MWAH!,"The Ben & Jerry's line of ice cream is some of the best I have ever tasted. When I spied this, the newest in the freezer at my local grocery I was intrigued. So I ponied up my cash and brought it home. As usual, I popped the top and took a taste. OMG! I was floored. This has to be added to the line-up as a permanent option.It is everything I did not expect it to be. The flavors burst in your mouth! The combination of cinnamon and chocolate, although seemingly odd, are perfect together. And the ""topping on the cake"" is the spicy fudge brownie. Love this new flavor."
8_bj,2019-12-11,5,I Need This Forever,"I can't stop buying this flavor. The balance of cinnamon ice cream, chocolate ice cream, tiny chunks of cinnamon bun dough, and bits of spicy brownie?! OH MY GOD. It's perfect. I saw a picture of this flavor online and then noticed it in my local grocery store, so I bought it. That was a month ago and now I can't stop. Please please please, Mr. Ben and Mr. Jerry I am begging you from my soul to keep this in the permanent rotation. JUSTICE TASTES DELICIOUS."
8_bj,2019-09-25,5,amazing flavor! even more amazing cause,So glad to see B&J step it up on the activism front as well as on the taste buds front! This is a delicious ice cream
8_bj,2019-11-19,5,Went back and bought every last pint,"This flavor combination is out of this world with perfect balance of flavors, textures and ... that cinnamon spice is everything. i wanted to try this initially because I support the cause and I was curious about how the flavor combo would be - and now I’m here begging you to add this to the regular rotation of flavors even though I never write reviews. I just went and bought out my local stores stock. Please add this to the regular line up!"
8_bj,2020-01-22,4,Pretty good flavor! Worth trying.,"I saw this in the store and had to buy it as soon as I saw the words ""spicy brownie."" They weren't lying, the brownies have a really interesting kick! I can understand why it was too strong for some, but for me it made up for the lack of cinnamon promised in the ice cream and cinnamon bun dough (which basically was like their cookie dough in texture minus the chips). This is a flavor for people who like the classics but are bold enough to try out some more exotic ones. Overall, one of the most intriguing flavors I've had from Ben and Jerry's."
8_bj,2020-01-27,5,If This is Discontinued....,"I'm not sure I will ever love again! This is a fantasticly unusual combination that just hits every mark for me. I can usually ration out my pints over a couple weeks, but this flavor only lasts me two sittings! Anytime you need a break from the sugary cinnamon, the deep rich chocolate is there to smooth things over with a little spice and vice versa. I would definitely become a regular fanatic if this became a daily flavor (r.i.p. my diet)"
8_bj,2020-01-31,5,I LOVE this flavor,"It's so good! The cinnamon seems to pervade the entire pint and the spicy brownie bits are so tasty and interesting! I don't think that Ben and Jerry's has another flavor with a spicy element and I don't think that they need another one if they were to just keep this one around, which is exactly what they should do! I am gonna be so sad when they take this one away. I get that its kind of a weird flavor but it seems like the people who like it, REALLY love it."
8_bj,2019-10-20,5,Best new flavor yet,"This flavor is exactly what I didn’t know I needed, the cinnamon ice cream and hint of heat from the brownies really make it something special. I hope Justice ReMix’d becomes a regular flavor, it’s one of the best in the Ben and Jerry’s lineup and I’d be so sad to see it go."
8_bj,2019-11-07,5,Love love love this flavor,"Someone brought this in at work and I immediately fell in love with it. It has chocolate, chunky dough, and cinnamon!! So Good!"
8_bj,2019-10-08,5,LOVE,"This flavor combined my two favorite desserts - chocolate and cinnamon rolls. To me, it tastes like the Mexican hot chocolate, Abuelita - which I LOVE! I didn’t read that the brownies were spicy, so I was confused at first, but it was a great addition!"
8_bj,2019-10-27,5,PLEASE KEEP THIS FLAVOR!,"I’m an ultimate half baked person, and this is amazing and just what I wanted. Please keep it is so good!!!"
8_bj,2019-10-11,5,Wonderful Combo!,Whoever expresses this as a disappointment is wild. All these flavors paired wonderfully and the spice to the brownie is like a cinnamon spice and so delightful. I'll be sad once this is gone! Love it!!
8_bj,2020-05-06,5,Please Keep Making this Flavor,This is my favorite flavor ever. Its the only flavor I buy now when I get ice cream and I always buy 3 or 4 pints of it at a time out of fear it won't be there when I go to the store next. I love the cinnamon and spicy brownie combination. There isn't a substitute to this and I will actually cry when its no longer available.
8_bj,2019-10-30,5,PLEASE KEEP THIS FLAVOR FOREVER,"I am in love with this ice cream as of many others I know, I always seem to become OBSESSED with a product when it is a “Limited edition” item. For the first time ever I am actually contacting a company in hopes to continue my obsession with this fantastic ice cream. PLEASE keep this flavor available!! :)"
8_bj,2019-10-23,5,Chunk-a-licious!,"This is how every flavor pint should be! Gorgeous chunks evenly distributed throughout, creamy, chocolatey with a cinnamon zing. Phenomenal."
8_bj,2019-12-08,5,PLEASE Make this a Regular Flavor!!,This is actually some of the best ice cream I have Ever had. All the spicy elements blend perfectly with the chocolate to create something I can only describe as the apotheosis of Mexican hot chocolate. Please don't take this deliciousness away from me!!! Make this a regular flavor!
8_bj,2019-11-05,5,Yum.,"Bought this yesterday at my local supermarket and ate half the pint already. Love it, love it, love it."
8_bj,2019-12-12,5,OMG AMAZING,LOVE LOVE LOVE! Please keep this flavor definitely one of my favorites I can’t get enough of it!!!!!
8_bj,2019-11-11,5,My FAVORITE Flavor Ever!,Please please PLEASE keep this flavor!! It is my all time favorite Ben and Jerry’s flavor!
8_bj,2019-12-13,5,Omg! Keep!,I love the cinnamon bun and can't find it saw this and tried it! Best flavor ever! Please please please.keep!
8_bj,2019-10-25,5,Spicy love!!!,Loved the cinnabon pieces and the spicy brownie pieces!
8_bj,2019-10-13,5,Hands down best flavor,...and you will not change my mind. Its cruel and unusual that this is a limited edition batch.
8_bj,2020-01-18,5,Great combination of flavors!,"This is the kind of pint that I could eat in one sitting, but have to hold back to save more for the next day. The combination of flavors are exquisite in my opinion!! Nothing to complain about for me. If you’re scared of the spicy chocolate, know it is not very spicy and quite delicious. THIS ICE CREAM NEEDS TO BE PERMANENT because I’ve realized I can’t live without it now. Please consider keeping it!!!!"
8_bj,2019-11-23,5,Incredible Combination!,"I was skeptical initially on the spicy fudge brownies, but holy Hannah! It’s 1000% amazing! It is darn near impossible to stop at one serving. I hope this stays around for a while, or I’ll have to get another freezer to stock up!"
8_bj,2020-02-11,5,crying,I'd never had a favorite ice cream flavor before I tried Justice ReMix'd and now I've gone through five pints and counting and I would sacrifice my firstborn to keep it in the roster forever
8_bj,2020-05-29,5,Perfection!,"This flavor is complete perfection! It’s the perfect balance of chocolate and cinnamon. I love the spicy brownie (not too spicy) and the cinnamon roll. I just keep buying multiple pints every time I go to a grocery store because this flavor is almost singlehandedly getting me through the stress of working during the pandemic. As an added bonus to the delicious flavor, the nonprofit connection is for criminal justice reform - ice cream doesn’t get any better than this! I hope you add it as a permanent flavor!"
8_bj,2020-01-04,5,One of my favorites!,At first I didn't feel the spice from the brownie but when it's eaten alone its definitely there. This flavor is sooo good. I wish it would be a permanent flavor.
8_bj,2020-01-17,4,Love this one,I was really excited to try this one when I heard about it I love the spicy sweet aspect and really wish they would make this one of the regular flavors
8_bj,2020-02-05,3,Spicy brownies I love,The ice creams are blah but the spiced up brownies saved the pint...until I ate it. All.
8_bj,2020-02-17,5,Happy Surprise,"My curiousity stopped on the label at 'gobs of cinnamon bun dough', so I didn't even notice the ""spicy fudge brownie"" part. Turned out I don't actually like the little cinnamon dough buttons (easy to spit out), but the spicy brownies really made this worth the purchase. I hope they revisit it again, Loving the cinnamon/spicy chocolate combo."
8_bj,2019-10-02,3,Too spiced,The icecream itself and the cinnamon buns were good but the brownie was too strongly spiced.
8_bj,2020-02-29,5,The Most Interesting Flavor,"I haven't found a new ice cream flavor like this in awhile. I would love to have it permanently, because it is my fave flavor currently! Very odd, but satisfying. The spiciness of the brownies works perfect with the sweetness of the mix of the cinnammon bun dough and ice cream. I'd love to see more creativity like this in my ice cream!"
8_bj,2020-06-21,5,The best ice cream ever. Make it permanent!!,Ever since this ice cream has come out I always have a pint of it in the fridge. Seriously right now I have 3. Not only is this my favorite ice cream of all time but it also supports a great cause so maybe we can be lucky enough to keep this pint because as long as you guys make it I will keep buying it.
8_bj,2020-03-26,2,Just didn't do it for me but I really wish it did,"I was more disappointed in myself than I was in this ice cream. I really wish I liked it. I really do. All the mix-ins were right up my alley. I don't know where my taste buds took a wrong turn. I had visions of a cinnamon roll with spicy hot chocolate to wash it down, but instead it was like a roller derby of playfully competitive flavours fighting each other to win. In turn, they ended up too black and blue to discern who was who. :'("
8_bj,2020-01-30,5,This ice cream cured my depression,NEEDS TO BE A PERMANENT FLAVOR! I can’t believe there’s a flavor that combines my favorites— cinnamon bun with Half Baked. Every bite was so interesting and delightful. A whole pint goes down eeeeasy. I hope I can find this again. DEFINITELY a new favorite.
8_bj,2020-02-19,5,Addicted To CinnaBuns & Chocolate Ice Cream,Was first time trying and I'm addicted the spicy fudge brownies paired with the sweet chocolate ice cream and cinnamon bun dough is to die for thanks @Ben&Jerry's for the best I've cream always - Ricco
8_bj,2020-04-29,1,"Yuck, spicy brownies!","The flavors did not go well together AT ALL. It sounded interesting so I decided to give it a try. I like spicy food but the spicy brownie mixed with the strong cinnamon flavor was vile. If I had very much of it, I Would be nauseous . The second I bit in to the brownie, I thought “this is disgusting “. Absolutely the worst Ben & Jerry’s flavor I have tried and the worst flavor of ANY ice cream I’ve ever tried.GROSS."
8_bj,2020-02-13,5,My favorite flavor yet!,"Oh my gosh, I loooooooove the mixture of chocolate and spicy brownies! It reminds of Mexican hot cocoa. I vote to keep this flavor forever!"
8_bj,2020-06-23,5,Please keep!,"Please make this a permanent flavor. It’s one of the most unique, delicious flavors you’ve ever produced."
8_bj,2020-01-25,5,It’s soooo good!,"If you like Mexican hot chocolate, you’ll like this! It’s delicious!"
8_bj,2020-04-06,1,Not Working,The cinnamon spice is way too aggressive - tastes more like strong gingerbread - and the flavor doesn’t pair well with the chocolate at all.
8_bj,2020-03-06,5,PLEASE KEEP THIS FOREVER,New favorite ice cream. Ate all of it in one night. Heck yeah
8_bj,2020-03-30,5,!! My favorite !!,This is the combination of all of my favorite things and I'm so happy. It is so delicious and I hope Ben and Jerry's never stops making it. I'd always wondered about the lack of Ben and Jerry's cinnamon ice cream because it's my absolute favorite -- and Justice Remix'd knocked it out of the park. Everything is so cinnamony and chocolately. I love the chunks. SO GOOD.
8_bj,2020-07-18,5,This flavor does ice cream JUSTICE!,"I bought this a week ago because it sounded delicious. After finishing the first one a couple days ago I just had to get another. I had to go to two stores to get one and learned it's a limited batch. I LOVE cinnamon ice cream, mix that with cinnamon bun dough and spicy brownies and it is heaven on earth. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE add this to your line of regularly available flavors. I would hate to lose it as quickly as I discovered it."
8_bj,2020-03-08,3,Parts of it are good.,The cinnamon ice cream and chocolate ice cream are great. And the cinnamon bun dough is out of this world!! But the spicy brownie in it overpowers everything. I end up picking it out of the ice cream. Honestly either the brownie needs to be taken out all together or the brownie needs to be a plain brownie instead of a spicy one. There is also so much brownie in it so it could also stand to be toned down in that regard as well
8_bj,2020-06-15,1,Why????,"I got this flavor by accident. Had done curbside pickup at the grocery, but instead of Phish Food, I received this. It sat in the freezer for about a week and decided to try it. I honestly feel like my taste buds were being punished, as if i lost a bet and was forced to eat this. If fear factor created an ice cream flavor, this would be it. None of the flavors work together. The cinnamon is too strong. Would be better if it tasted more like a cinnamon roll than the cinnamon challenge from a few years back. The spicy brownie makes no sense. The flavor is so off putting, i wanted to gag. They could have easily used some sort of Mexican hot chocolate flavor and it would have been so much better. I really have no words except this is one of the most vile and disgusting flavors I have ever eaten. Save your money and make a donation to your favorite social justice charity."
8_bj,2020-06-06,5,Singing to the Tune of Justice,"Not only does this ice cream flavor support a I cause important to me, but it's an amazing texture and flavor combo. That spicy ribbon of fudgy brownie?! Those cinnamon roll chunks?! My tongue is dancing to this beat. How does this not have an average of 5 stars already? It's the remix I needed. Play it again! Make it a permanent member on the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Playlist."
8_bj,2020-02-22,5,Omg heaven,I wish this flavor was around year round I never knew I needed this in my life until I unlowingky took a bite into the most heavenly thing I’ve ever eaten. I LOVE IT
8_bj,2020-06-11,5,You had me at cinnamon,Went looking for Justice Remix'd ice cream because of a facebook post that led me to Ben & Jerry's civic and social commitment. The Ice cream happens to contain a cinnamon and brownie deliciousness that I love and is hard to find together. A true surprise and delight. Thank you so much and if the blueberry one comes about I know I'll like that one too.
8_bj,2020-06-26,5,A great message on a great icecream.,"So many ice creams these days are one trick ponies: sweet on sweet on sweet. A well balanced dessert needs multiple notes. This delivers. Warm cinnamon, spicy brownies, bitter chocolate and of course smooth sweet Ben and Jerry's icecream."
8_bj,2020-02-21,1,Too sweet,Sugary and not great. This is probably my least favorite flavor I have ever had of Ben and Jerry's.
8_bj,2020-01-16,1,Really wanted to like it...,I wanted to like this flavor so badly but I just didn’t. The spicy brownie ruined it for me. I ended up digging out the brownie and just eating the rest.
8_bj,2020-08-29,3,I Can't Remember This,"I know I bought this, but I can't remember it. So that means that A. it's not horrible and B. it's not outstanding. Kind of like a blind date who is certain to end up with someone decent and you wish him the best, but he's not for you. I'd probably buy it again just to make sure I wasn't intoxicated the first time and that's why I forgot."
8_bj,2020-02-19,1,God awful,Just bought this and took three bites and I couldn’t swallow any more this is the most disgusting ice cream I’ve ever had I don’t know how it made it to the shelves
8_bj,2020-01-05,1,Justice Remix,I love Ben & Jerry's however this one is not for me..Dissapointed.
8_bj,2020-01-03,1,"Good cause, bad f!avor!",Super icky. I've never thrown away an almost full pint of Ben &Jerry's before The cinnamon flavor was too strong and the spicy brownies absolutely unpleasant.
8_bj,2020-06-17,1,Grooosssss,"Don't waste your time. Much like protests, the whole thing is ruined by disgusting spicy chocolate!"
8_bj,2020-01-16,5,My new favorite,"I love this flavor so much that it is now my official go to! The surprising bite of spicy brownie is so delicious! I was hesitant to try it because I can't do too spicy anymore, but this has just a small amount of spice which oddly balances with the sweet! I hope this becomes a part of the permanent collection!"
8_bj,2020-06-29,5,Not a chocolate fan,"I’m not a chocolate fan at all, but I love cinnamon so I decided to give this flavor a try and im glad I did!! The chocolate wasn’t overwhelming and the cinnamon mellowed it out. I loved the chunks of spicy fudge and cinnamon bun dough. This was super creative and perfectly executed"
8_bj,2020-07-07,5,Incredible mission,"Thank you for using your platform for good. Ice cream flavours are incredible with real ice cream! It amazes me how socially responsible this company is. I 100% recommend this brand to everyone I know any chance I get. Incredible flavours, incredible missions, worth the price! "
8_bj,2020-04-03,5,"Amazing, unique taste!","I'll admit - the colorful packaging and good cause drew me in. Who knew that the cinnamon that lingers would be the thing that keeps me walking back to the fridge each night around 9:30pm? I'm not an ice cream addict, but this flavor is more like a gourmet treat. Indulge!"
8_bj,2020-06-26,1,Horrible.,Probably the worst ice cream that has ever been created. Absolutely disgusting
8_bj,2020-02-06,5,So Uniquely Yummy,I love Ben and Jerry's because their ice cream is delicious and because they support good causes. This flavor looked interesting and I like knowing that a portion of the money I spent might help make a difference. I ended up eating the whole pint in one sitting
8_bj,2020-05-19,5,Good stuff.,"If you don't like the flavor profile, chances are you won't like this pint of ice cream. However, if it sounds good to you like it does to me, pretty sure you'll enjoy this ice cream. My only complaint is I wish it had more of the spicy fudge brownie pieces"
8_bj,2020-04-24,1,Ehhhhh,I was so excited to try this but it was absolutely terrible. It made my stomach hurt and I literally was nauseous.
8_bj,2020-02-08,5,THE. BEST. FLAVOR. EVER.,"I have never written a review here before, but I thought this necessary to see if you could make it permanent. It is so so so good. The spicy chocolate and everything is amazing. I went back and bought our grocer out. Please make it permanent. :)"
8_bj,2020-04-12,5,Yummy cinnamon!,What a change of pace! Not a huge fan of chocolate but the cinnamon gives it a good balance. What's B&J without something gooey? Oh yes! Gooey gobs of cinnamon bun dough and brownies! Even the brownies are magical! The taste bursts on my tongue!
8_bj,2020-04-01,1,Awful,"The flavor combination is disgusting, obviously no real thought went into this ice cream and I doubt anyone taste tested it."
8_bj,2020-06-17,4,Not what I expected but really good!,I didn’t really know what to expect with this flavor and it was different but still super good. It is pretty powerful on the cinnamon and with the spicy brownies but everything complemented super well together. Would probably buy again.
8_bj,2020-07-24,5,make it PERMANENT!!,"I found this at the grocery store once and I fell in love with it. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find it anywhere after that. I really want this flavor of Justice will become a permanent flavor!!!!!!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!"
8_bj,2020-09-05,5,Great flavor experience,I absolutely loved the cinnamon and chocolate flavor combination. It's very unique flavor in the best way possible. It's easily one of my new favorites. The spice in the fudge brownies is perfect to fight against the sweet.
8_bj,2020-06-08,1,Tastes like dirt,Horrible flavor. Get rid of it. One of your worst ever.
8_bj,2020-06-03,5,Addicting and amazing!,"I impulse bought the last pint of this my Kroger had, and I swear to you it’s the best ice cream I’ve ever had! The spicy brownies were absolute perfection! The only problem? I’m craving more and can’t find it anywhere!"
8_bj,2020-06-05,1,Not good! Bring back One Sweet Whirled.,Why not bring back some of the good flavors from the graveyard instead of garbage like this?
8_bj,2020-03-12,5,OMG! My new favorite!!!,"Seriously, please keep this flavor on the shelves and available forever! I love cinnamon buns and brownies. But the spicy brownies were new to me--and now they're an absolute favorite! Can't get enough."
8_bj,2020-05-15,5,Amazing Taste!,"Bought this just to try it after reading the label, I was intrigued by the spicy brownie aspect (I LOVE Mexican brownies). Ate it right out of the pint, and was SO GOOD!!!!!! definitely a new favorite!"
8_bj,2020-05-29,5,A favorite for cinnamon lovers!!,"This is wonderful! Definitely different than your “traditional” flavors, but I seek this one out! I wish it was easier to find!! You have to LOVE cinnamon though— some strong flavors here!"
8_bj,2020-02-11,5,Please make this permanent!,"This ice cream is amazing, the flavors go together so well and remind me of Mexican style hot chocolate with a lovely spicy kick! Please add this to your permanent roster of flavors!!!"
8_bj,2020-04-15,5,Great Ice Cream - Great Cause,"This flavor absolutely rules and I hope it never goes away. I love that Ben & Jerry's takes social justice seriously as a company, and I love the work they've done with Senator Sanders."
8_bj,2020-06-29,5,Ben and Jerry for president,AMAZING FLAVOUR! Ben and Jerry are so awesome that I don’t mind paying more for this ice cream because they pay their employees very well. Great guys. Gen Z loves and approves!!
8_bj,2020-03-12,5,One of the best ice creams I’ve ever had,"I’ve eaten way too many kinds of ice cream, and this is easily one of the most amazing and creative kinds that I have ever had. Any time I see it in a store I have to buy it."
8_bj,2020-04-17,5,My Favorite Flavor,"I almost didn't buy this, but my daughter convinced me to try it. It's amazing! I love that it has just a bit of brownie spiciness with the sweetness of the ice cream."
8_bj,2020-06-08,5,New favorite!,"All of the flavors pair very well with each other, the brownies add just a touch of spiciness that is complimented by the chocolate. This is going to be my new go to!"
8_bj,2020-06-06,5,The best flavor,This is seriously such a good flavor. The brownie in it has enough cinnamon to give it a kick but isn’t overbearing and the little cinnamon bun bits are phenomenal.
8_bj,2020-05-19,5,Spicy Mexican hot chocolate and Cinnabon,Anyone who rates this below a 4/5 is foolish! This tastes like heaven !! Spicy brownie batter with cinnamon ice cream and Cinnabon pieces. I hope this stays forever
8_bj,2019-09-23,1,Thumbs down,Hi I just kept feeling like they are reaching for flavors on this one. Bring back dastardly mash and New York super chunk
8_bj,2020-05-15,5,My favorite flavor!!,I absolutely LOVE this flavor. It's sweet with just a touch of spice with my favorite flavors. PLEASE make this a permanent flavor!!
8_bj,2020-03-17,5,Please make this a regular flavor!,"OMG it's so good, spicy brownie, it's like you have been listening to my inner ice cream dream thoughts! Thank You : )"
8_bj,2020-04-13,4,its good but not the best,i bought this awhile ago and it's good. i really realized that I was white when I though the cinnamon was spicy lol
8_bj,2020-03-14,5,I'm obsessed,I love this! It's my favorite ice cream since Late Night Snack. I wish it would become a permanent flavor.
8_bj,2020-05-18,5,LOVE IT!!!,So good!!!! Please keep this one as a regular! It's the closest thing I can find to Mexican Chocolate.
8_bj,2020-02-12,5,yum!,the best ice cream flavor out there! the spice is phenomenal and it NEEDS to be a regular flavor
8_bj,2020-03-08,5,Cinnamon and chocolate,Are a combination meant for holy matrimony. This flavor needs to be made a permanent option.
8_bj,2020-03-13,5,Yummmmmm,Please keep this flavor it’s my favorite the cinnamon and chocolate are a perfect combo
8_bj,2020-05-18,5,PLEASE KEEP IT FOREVER,I love this flavor so much this is my favorite pls dont ever get rid of it im begging
8_bj,2020-04-29,5,Love the name!,This is by far my favorite flavor of all time with Cinnamon Bun. Please keep it!!!
8_bj,2020-06-17,5,Love the flavor,Absolutely love this ice cream!!!! I’ve never been disappointed when trying flavors
8_bj,2020-06-10,4,Not for everyone but I like it,Not for everyone but I like it. Lots of cinnamon flavor and a nice hit of chili
8_bj,2020-06-16,5,Zing!,This is an amazing combination of flavors. Please make it a regular!
8_bj,2020-03-19,5,Wish it were here to stay,"They’ve done it again! Few things I crave, now this is on the list"
8_bj,2020-02-08,5,Best new flavor!,Love this flavor so much! Dethroned several of my favorites!
9_bj,2020-06-16,5,Please make boots on moon a regular flavor!,"I love this flavor, and am already sad that it is a limited item. Yummy chocolate ice cream with crispy toffee & fudge cows and sugar cookie core. It's all amazing, and a terrific combination! Please please please, how do we make it a regular flavor?"
9_bj,2020-06-24,5,Worthy of being a regular flavor!,Bought this the other day and omg I am in love! This needs to be available always please don’t take it away it’s too good to not be around for long!!! The sugar cookie core is to die for!!
9_bj,2020-08-14,5,DUUUUUDEEEE...,"I’m just gnna say. This one makes me wanna sit on the couch and just smile n dance like a chunky little kid gettin’ their ice cream shimmy on!!! The chocolate ice cream, for some reason, tastes so dang good in this batch! The toffee bits are such an awesome touch to it. The fudge cows, another awesome texture element with a hit of a nice bittersweet dark chocolate to contrast the sweet/salty toffee crunch and silky smooth milk chocolate ice cream. But the dang killer here is....... that SUGAR COOKIE CORE. WHOA B&J... ur just showing off now. That stuff.... is like.. out of this world (; U should really put a litttlleee more in the pint hehe! :D
But anywho, it’s Uber yummy!! Wouldn’t be surprised if it became a next hit and stuck around!"
9_bj,2020-06-23,5,New Favorite,"This is my favorite Netflix B&J flavor and I will be purchasing again. I was worried this would be too sweet but has the perfect balance of chocolate, toffee, fudge, and sugar cookie core. The sugar cookie core is not overbearing like some other core flavors. I also love the that the texture is both smooth and crunchy. I hope this become permanent"
9_bj,2020-08-23,1,Good idea but weird,"I was excited to try this new flavor last week. What's not to love about fudge cows, toffee, and sugar cookie. Unfortunately for me it was a major flop. The ice cream and fudge cows were enjoyable. The toffee clusters were a weird texture experience, unfortunately. I was expecting something more along the lines of the toffee in Everything But The.... which I really enjoy. The real disappointment, and reason I'm actually taking the time to review ice cream, was the sugar cookie dough core. For me, it just tasted of wet sugar. Grainy, too soft, no flavor. Ben and Jerry's has set high expectations for their products, but sadly this one didn't deliver for me."
9_bj,2020-07-09,5,BEST ICE CREAM EVER.,The combination of flavors in this ice cream is OUT OF THIS WORLD! I was lucky enough to find one pint and have been searching for more. I really hope this becomes a regular flavor because I’m obsessed. I’ve been checking all the stores nearby and everywhere is sold out. Please please please keep this one around!
9_bj,2020-06-19,5,Out of This World!,The combination of flavors makes an incredible medley for your taste buds! It was exciting to try a new flavor. The sugar cookie dough is absolutely heavenly. You have to try this new flavor combination!
9_bj,2020-06-22,5,Boots on the Mooo'n is out of this world!,"Hole-y Cow!!! (Hole-y as in holes. You know, because craters...? Oh well.) Couldn't wait for Boots to show up in stores, so when it did, I pounced. I would be over the moon if this was made a regular flavor. For heaven's sake, do it! This is one of the best B&J flavors I've ever had. Been eating B&J for decades."
9_bj,2020-08-06,5,Best Chocolate Ice Cream in the Solar System!,I tried this last week for the first time on a whim (because there was no other B&J's left at the grocery store). I was nervous because myself and my partner are not usually chocolate ice cream lovers but this one has changed our minds!! The cookie core and other bits balance out the chocolate ice cream PERFECTLY. I've been trying to track it down again since but it seems people have caught on to it and it's been sold out. You have to try it!
9_bj,2020-07-09,5,We love it!!!,"My son and I can’t stop talking about how good this flavor is, and how we would sign a petition to get it made a permanent Ben and Jerry’s variety! Please continue to make it...the combination of fudge and sugar cookies and toffee! oMG!"
9_bj,2020-07-07,5,Even better than the show!!,"After searching all the stores in my area, I was finally able to get my hands on what I now believe to be my new favorite. Please don't let this be a limited batch! It's too good to disappear!!!!"
9_bj,2020-08-11,5,Most amazing flavor I’ve ever witnessed,"I bought this flavor a week ago, hearing about it from the office ladies podcast. It sounded good and I love supporting them and also Space Force, so I had to buy it. I am not kidding when I say this is literally the best flavor I’ve ever had. And it’s not even close to my old favorite go-to of cookie dough and cookies and cream, so that says ALOT. This needs to be a permanent flavor. 500 stars."
9_bj,2020-07-22,5,Holy Moly!,I got a serious case of the munchies and this was the best icecream a person could ask for...A ice cream for the Gods! and them mini chocolate cows got me feeling like a archaeologist digging thru looking for there goodness. Hats off!!
9_bj,2020-06-29,5,Out of this World!!,Move over Phish Food and Cherry Garcia and Coffee Coffee Buzz Buzz and Americone Dream- all legit faves of mine! And make room New York Super Fudge Chunk because there is a new Wowzer in space!! PLEASE make this one stay in orbit!!!
9_bj,2020-06-29,5,Keep Forever!,Searched high and low for this flavor. Finally found it and bought 6 pints! Everyone in our family (5 of us) is obsessed with it. Hands down a winner! Especially love the toffee clusters in this ice cream!
9_bj,2020-07-12,5,"Literally, out of this world!","The toffee bits sold me on this initially, but every part of this flavor was a delicious surprise! Everything from the milk chocolate ice cream to the cookie core... so good!!"
9_bj,2020-08-03,5,Please make this a permanent flavor!,"This is my new favorite icecream. I really hope you guys keep it on forever. Usually it takes me months to finish a pint (I know, it's weird) but this one I finished in a day."
9_bj,2020-08-02,5,Please please please make this a regular flavor,I never write reviews for anything. This is the best ice cream I HAVE EVER EATEN! Please please please make this regular.
9_bj,2020-09-23,5,Freaking delicious,"I bought this today and holy camoly it is so good. The sugar cookie dough is to die for. Can you all please make this regular. Please. It is a perfect balance of sweet and the toffee adds some saltiness, and the sugar cookie dough just finishes it off."
9_bj,2020-07-14,5,Nothing but fun for the mouth,"The milk chocolate flavor is excellent, and there are tons of things to keep your mouth entertained. Awesome!"
9_bj,2020-07-24,5,my dream pint,I love the special cows! and literally everything else about this pint. it’s so good in every way
9_bj,2020-07-20,5,Absolutely AMOOOOZING!,"I went back and bought the rest of them at my local store.
Please make these a regular flavor!"
9_bj,2020-07-21,5,YAAAAAAAAS,"I'm sitting on the couch devouring this entire pint. Make this flavor permanent, i need it in my life. Love chocolate based ice creams with crunchy additions like almonds, chocolate, toffee, etc. Most are ruined with marshmallow so this was an exciting flavor to find! My other fave is New York Super Fudge Chunk. We need more chocolate flavors like these!"
9_bj,2020-08-28,5,"Make it Regular, PLEASE!","I went to five stores in my area looking for ""Boots on the Moon"". I love all things MOON, and I thought I would like it, and I was wrong - I LOVE it! I had some for breakfast today...and dinner tonight. I am glad I live alone, so I don't have to share it! Am I addicted to it? Will an intervention be called for? Tune in, and make it regular!!!!"
9_bj,2020-09-20,5,AMAZING,"My usual pint, Milk and Cookies has taken a back seat. The sugar cookie core + the toffee is a combination to DIE FOR. Plus, we all know the delight that is B&J chocolate ice cream."
9_bj,2020-08-02,5,Amazing!,"One of my new favorite flavors, I’m so sad that it’s not a regular flavor. The sugar cookie core is my favorite part, and the toffee clusters add a great sweet crunch. Would definitely keep purchasing this if they made it a regular flavor."
9_bj,2020-08-08,5,Best. Flavor. Ever.,Seriously...never get rid of this...even if the show doesn't continue on (which it should)...never ever ever get rid of this amazing flavor combination.
9_bj,2020-09-18,5,SWEET BABY JESUS please keep this flavor around!,"I seem to have discovered this flavor just as it was going out of stock. Got one for me and one for my wife, and we both thought it was fan-freaking-tastic. It even has a hint of malt flavor, whether unintentional or due to a confluence of other ingredients. I'd have trouble choosing between this and Phish Food, and that's saying something! I'd be even more stoked if you could make a froyo version, 'cuz the reduced calories and saturated fat would let me eat it more often!"
9_bj,2020-08-10,5,Favorite EVER!,This is seriously my fave!!! Please make it permanent!!!
9_bj,2020-07-20,5,I need this,My new favorite flavor from you please make more!!!!!
9_bj,2020-09-16,5,Would give 10 stars if i could.,"Okay I’m not joking when I say I love and hate this flavor at the same time. I pe this flavor because it is BY FAR the best tasting Ben and Jerry’s flavor ever made, no competition... and i amd a huge Ben and Jerry’s fan. The reason I hate it is because this flavor has caused me to gain like 30 lbs at this point because I cannot stop eating it. It does not get old. Ever. The crunchy sweetness of the toffee is spot on amd just pairs PERFECTLY with the sugar cookie core and the milk chocolate ice cream. Oh yeah, MILK CHOCOLATE. The milk chocolate is so good. I have eaten probably like 50 of these at this point and everytime the core is big and i never get a bad core. Every pint i have gotten has been just as good ig not better than the last. Please Ben amd Jerry’s. If you are reading this. DO NOT MAKE THIS A LIMITED TIME FLAVOR."
9_bj,2020-09-01,5,YES,"This new flavor is so good! I love it, it's like a fun twist on some well loved Phish Food flavors. The little chocolate cows are such a cute touch. I hope that this becomes a regular flavor, as it is now my favorite chocolate ice cream based B&J pint. My fav of all time will always be Salted Caramel Core, but this is a close second. Definitely for caramel and toffee fans, I even loved the sugar cookie core."
9_bj,2020-09-15,5,Shockingly Good,"I am not the biggest ice cream fan but I do like a good dessert, but this was everything I could have wanted from a dessert, creamy chocolate, a nice crunch of cookies and toffee, a smooth flavor that wants me going back for more. If your a fan of texture and something out of the ordinary give this a try, I know I did and I cannot wait to get more."
9_bj,2020-09-10,5,Until this becomes a regular flavor...stockpile.,When I first discovered this I was on the East Coast. Found it in a tiny gas station. After one scoop I immediately made plans to go back and buy the place out. Bought the remaining three pints the next day. We only had a week left on our trip but I had no issues finishing all 4 pints.
9_bj,2020-06-07,5,Chip Happens,Just tried chip happens..yummy! Don't know how you managed the chips in it but love the salty/sweet combo. Reminds me of b-day's as a child
9_bj,2020-09-20,5,My ABSOLUTE FAVORITE!!,I love this flavor SO MUCH! It's such a bummer when the limited time flavors are the best flavors. I still think about the 2016 Empower-mint. Please keep this one going. And maybe bring back the Empower-mint?
9_bj,2020-06-07,1,Almonds? Why?!,"This could’ve been fantastic, but you went and ruined it with Almonds, one of the most common food allergies!!"
9_bj,2020-09-20,5,Yummmmyy!!!,My daughter (19) and I think this is one of the best flavors. Can't stop wanting in our freezer. Please make it a regular.
9_bj,2020-09-16,5,Best Ice Cream Ever,Absolute favorite flavor! All the flavors compliment each other perfectly and make a final product that is absolutely to die for! Please please please make it a regular flavor!
9_bj,2020-09-08,5,Should be a regular.,"One of the best flavors out there.
At first the cookie core had me second guessing, but I was 100% wrong!
Everything about this is amazing.
Its a shame that its a limited batch."
9_bj,2020-09-13,2,Not as Great as the Others.,"Tastes kind-of bland. The sugar cookie core doesn’t really taste like much, especially when combined with the chocolate ice cream. Favorite part was the toffee pieces."
9_bj,2020-09-07,5,Delicious,Sugar cookie dough core make that into a flavor only
10_bj,2018-05-13,5,Perfect harmony,"I loved this ice cream so much I typed in Ben and Jerry's Americone Dream is amazing into Google. I wanted to add a review since there was only one so far... To my surprise the cone was still crispy and the amount of fudge covering the cone was not overwhelming whatsoever. But the caramel swirl is fantastic quality, bringing back memories of the first time I had caramel with a side of Apple. I chose this because I was looking for a non traditional flavor but not too rich, now don't get me wrong, eating half a pint is definitely a hefty load on the gut but it doesn't feel too busy and you still get to enjoy the ice cream."
10_bj,2017-11-05,5,Current fav BJ flavor,I've gone back to this flavor after favoring The Tonight Dough and the Caramel Core ones. I forgot what I was missing. I bought 2 the last time they were BOGO at Publix and go 2 more before the sale ended. I love caramel(I hate fudge) and the crispy chocolate covered waffle cones are tasty. Also I don't see many other options with waffle cone pieces. There have also been a lot of waffle cone in the pints.
10_bj,2017-09-30,5,Delicious,"Tastes good, satisfies my sweet tooth, and definitely represents the Americone Dream!!!! Also, you don't have to feel guilty about eating a pint because you're eating ice cream for charity (it's like a tax deduction.... calories get deducted if they're for charity)!!!!"
10_bj,2018-09-08,5,Awesome,"I typically try every new flavor that comes out when I see them. When they have no new flavors to try, my default is American dream. I love it!"
10_bj,2017-04-27,5,The best ice cream ever,"I eat a pint when I am sad, I eat a pint when I am happy, I eat a pint when I want to be happy... I keep eating this ice cream... SOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOD. This ice cream is truly dreamy"
10_bj,2017-09-11,5,And I don't like ice cream...,"I am not a big fan of vanilla ice cream. In fact, if it isn't coffee or chocolate I am usually not a fan at all; however, Americone Dream is a mix of fabulous flavors! No toppings or modifications are needed to make this a tasty treat for my son and I. The touch of waffle cone is a nice addition (though crunchier cone would be even better). Thanks for making a great ice cream!"
10_bj,2019-04-09,5,O M Geeeee!,Fell in love at the first taste and haven't looked back. No other ice cream can compare. June 19 was the first I saw and heard of the slices and now I won't sit and eat the entire pint. Thanks guys!
10_bj,2020-06-17,5,FAVORITE,"So between this and the new Gimme S’mores. It’s a TIE. I honestly can’t decide which one I like more. But this has been one of my favorites before Gimme S’mores. I love Americone Dream so much The ice cream and the caramel ripple and the chocolate covered cone parts is AMAZING.
Whoever said this needed more salt it DOES NOT. It is perfect the way it is. I found no issues with the crunchy part either.
It has the perfect amount of caramel perfect amount of crunch and chocolate ratio. This is like a drumstick but with more of that “good part”."
10_bj,2017-09-09,2,Could be delicious if revised,"It would be fantastic if the texture were better and it had something to balance out the sweet. Replacing plain caramel for salted caramel, or adding sea salt to the chocolate. Switching to dark chocolate. The cone pieces felt chewy or doughy, and I expected a crunch. Though I do suspect this has more to do with the freezing process. I'd like it a lot more if it was only one of these. While I don't care for it, I can see why lots of people love it. Good job!!"
10_bj,2018-05-15,1,Americone Slice,I chose this flavor for the caramel swirl as much as the fudge covered cone pieces...sadly it contained neither
10_bj,2020-07-28,5,,This is my fave ben and Jerrys flavor. I had it back when I met jerry at a speaking engagement. The little waffle cone pieces are perfect and the ice cream flavor is great. I have and will buy again!
10_bj,2020-06-01,5,,My favorite ice cream! Taste just like a drum stick!! Has the perfect amount of flavor [product:ben-&-jerrys-americone-dream-ice-cream]
10_bj,2019-07-03,5,Delicious,Very good ice cream u guys have. Americone Dream is me nd my wife's favorite flavor. I it new varieties coming out anytime soon?
10_bj,2018-06-18,5,Such a great flavor!,This one is pretty perfect in my opinion. All the elements work well together and the chocolate covered cone pieces were nice n’ crunchy!
10_bj,2018-10-11,3,,They have much better flavors. It’s not bad but I do not like that the waffle cone pieces get soggy
10_bj,2019-01-08,5,My life now has purpose!!,"I just want to say that now that I have found Ben & Jerry's Americone Dream ice cream, my life now has purpose!! That purpose is to get up everyday, eat Americone Dream ice cream until it's gone, drive to the store, buy some more, and repeat. This ice cream is EVERYTHING!!!!!! Please never stop making it!!!!"
10_bj,2017-04-12,5,Great Flavor,Excellent! This flavor has all sorts of things in it!
10_bj,2018-06-04,5,,Guilty pleasure! I think everyone can agree Ben & Jerry's is delicious no matter what kind you get. I really like the Americone Dream. I'm a huge fan of waffle cones so add that into the ice cream and I'm sold. I usually get the small pints with my boyfriend and we'll finish that in one sitting! It's so bad but so good :P
10_bj,2017-09-11,5,:o Conerrrrr,Such good ice cream. Like too good. I cannot physically stop myself from consuming this ice cream. The flavors and textures blend so well together and I am overwhelmed with the need to keep eating it. I am considering seeking professional help. Keep doing what you're doing. All the stars *************
10_bj,2020-07-07,5,,"My favorite ice cream! Its so delicious, especially the caramel swirl! Also Ben & Jerrys high key supports the #BLM movement. So we STAN Ben & Jerrys in this household. 10/10 recommend to anyone and everyone in literally the entire world. Go get you some Ben & Jerrys. Like. Right now."
10_bj,2017-11-04,4,Really good ice cream,"The vanilla ice cream is so good! Almost as good as my Grandma used to make! I am a caramel lover and could use a little more in this but it was yummy, and of course everyone loves the cone!"
10_bj,2018-03-04,5,Ingredients in every bite!,OMG.....amazing! First time trying this flavor and it did not disappoint! I love that the ingredients were in every bite. #happycustomer
10_bj,2017-09-29,5,Never Knew Something Could Be So Good!!,"I finally weaned myself off of the Strawberry Shortcake and then came Americone. Oooh Americone, I love you so!"
10_bj,2018-11-11,5,,"All of the best flavor combinations in one place! Sweet, salty, crunchy, creamy, chocolatey, waffly goodness!"
10_bj,2017-08-13,5,Yummy!!!! Perfect combo. Lots of caramel!!!,Satisfies all sorts of cravings. Crunchier and creamy. Love it while I watch the Steven Colbert show!!!
10_bj,2017-08-24,5,Best flavor ever!,Literally my favorite flavor. The waffle cone prices and magical.
10_bj,2017-12-07,5,The Best!!,So perfect!!!!!! The caramel swirl is amazing!!!!!
10_bj,2019-11-03,5,The Triple Threat!,"Beauty, brains, and brawn. Chocolate, caramel, cone. There are no wrong answers here. I'd say it tastes like heaven but something about it is just so sinful. Nothing should be this good and still be legal. Oh but it is. It so is. Haven't tried it? WRONG. You haven't just ""not tried it"", you haven't even started living. It is life giving. Fix it. Go forth. Brave the great wide world in search of the truth of the universe. (Hint: it's Americone Dream)."
10_bj,2018-07-07,5,Out of This World!,"This is one of the most delicious flavors of ice cream I’ve ever eaten. It’s sweet, crunchy, wonderfully gooey, with pieces of waffle cone, fudge, and caramel goodness. To make it even better, the proceeds go The Stephen Colbert’s AmeriCone Dream Fund, which feeds hungry children, provides them with medication, and also provides services to veterans. For what more could you ask? You’ll love it and feel good about helping those in need."
10_bj,2018-04-12,3,Least favorite B&J,"I'm new to B&J icecream, just got a whole bunch of flavors last month and out of ~10 this is my least favorite.
The good: The icecream is high quality, and what you would expect from B&Js, and the caramel was gooey and tasty.
The bad: The cone pieces had a soggy texture and were very unpleasant to eat, they were slightly chewy. Not sure if this is a result of my freezer or something, but I couldn't finish the whole pint."
10_bj,2017-06-13,3,Great flavor!,"I decided to go with something out of the blue but sadly I wasn't thrilled.... the waffle cones where soggy and didn't make me want to eat the whole pint, like how I usually do lol.... don't think I'll eat this one again.... :("
10_bj,2020-07-26,4,,"A good flavor! It's pretty simple- vanilla with caramel and fudge-covered waffle cone pieces- but sometimes that's all you need! I've definitely purchased this flavor more than once. The only slight flaw- and this wasn't an issue the last time I purchased it so maybe it got a bit better- was that the waffle cone pieces could be a bit too big sometimes. I'd still highly recommend it, though!"
10_bj,2020-07-28,4,,"This Ben & Jerry's was good, but not my favorite of their line. Idk if it's the label or the actual ice cream. I think it needs someone else on the label who doesn't hate our current president. I'm a repeat consumer, but I won't buy again because of that. I love America regardless of who our president is, but overall the flavor is actually great like all ben & Jerry's"
10_bj,2018-01-21,3,Needs different texture caramel,"The vanilla icecream part is amazing!!! The chocolate covered cone pieces and yummy, but the texture of the caramel is bad, i love caramel swirls in icecream but this light almost slime textured caramel really bothered me, i tried to.mix it in more or somethinh but it was like biting into a cold slime ball i couldn't eat it. But the rest of the icecream was great"
10_bj,2018-11-19,4,,I’ve always loved Ben & Jerry’s. I really like this flavor. It’s really sweet and all of these flavors together are amazingly good. The only bad thing about this flavor is that the ice cream cone chunks are soggy. Either than that it’s super good and I recommend! It’s an ice cream that you can get an upset tummy over because it’s not too much chocolate!
10_bj,2020-07-31,5,Worth the farts.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,"Lactose is not my friend. When I eat dairy I tend to clear out a room and be left alone. For this reason I don't eat dairy whenever possible. BUT THIS! I don't even care!! This is THE ONLY ICE CREAM I eat. My husband and kids and hide in the basement, I'm NEVER giving this up!!!!!
*plus they support the fight against racial inequality AMAZING!!!"
10_bj,2019-03-05,5,,This one is my husbands favorite. I prefer Phish Food or Half Baked. I'm so addicted that sometimes I will eat a whole pint in one setting. It's a little costly but sometimes you can find it on sale. I live this and nbn if you like ice cream then you would enjoy this. Check out Phish food andHalf Baked. Half baked has brownie in it...omg
10_bj,2020-03-23,5,Sooo good! Love the Caramel!,"My husband bought me this and it was sooo good I had to look it up to show my sister to convince her to get this flavor... and see if everyone agreed with me!! It made my night. I am usually not a huge fan of ice creams, I am pretty plain and like basic flavors like coffee, vanilla, and strawberry but man was this ice cream good!!"
10_bj,2020-07-31,4,,This is my favorite Ben & Jerry flavor! It's the perfect amount of sweet for my sugar cravings. I like the waffle cone bits which give it a crunch and some texture. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because some batches tend to have soft pieces of waffle cone. The waffle cones are not consistently crunchy with every pint i buy.
10_bj,2019-03-02,5,,"This is my favorite ice cream ever. I cant say this enough. They currently dont have it at the Walmart near me so I have to get it whenever Im at food lion. Its so worth it though. I think my favorite part is the waffle cone pieces. My only complaint is that there isnt enough caramel, but thats just because I love caramel."
10_bj,2020-06-22,5,,The best combination of things. I like vanilla based things more than chocolate ice cream based things and so I stay away from a lot of Ben and Jerrys flavors because most are the latter. This is great for a vanilla lover. With pieces of fudge and caramel (waffle cone pieces). The gooey-ness is real and drool worthy. YUM.
10_bj,2020-07-24,5,,"Great brand, amazing quality and this flavor is just perfect The crunchy waffle cones with caramel and the vanilla is just the right blend however I add chocolate syrup in with mine to give it more of a chocolate flavor I'm not big on the vanilla ice cream but with chocolate syrup mix in it's perfect summer time treat"
10_bj,2019-03-01,5,Definitely an ice cream dream!!,"This is one of my all time favorite flavors!! The ingredients go together so well!! The waffle cone pieces are very easy to chew, I get a rush of gooey goodness when it's mixed with the caramel swirl, and I get the ultimate satisfaction in enjoying a very tasty ice cream pint!! Please don't ever discontinue this flavor!"
10_bj,2017-06-25,5,AMAZINGGG,I'm lactose intolerant so I tend to stay away from ice cream but every now and then I give in . This by far has the be the best ice cream that I have ever had and it's also my first and only time trying Ben & Jerry's . Haven decided when I think that I'm going to try a new flavor yet because so far this is the one .
10_bj,2019-02-06,5,,"Ben & Jerrys will always be my favorite ice cream from the store! These pints are packed with flavor - mainly because while developing the product Ben, who suffered from a disease that left him unable to smell, couldnt taste the flavor of the ice cream! So, they just kept adding flavor! Which turned out GREAT for us."
10_bj,2018-12-04,5,,I love this brand of ice cream. I have no complaints with any flavors from this company. Growing up we lived near a Ben & Jerry's and that was our treat. I love this particular flavor because of the different bits added to it. In short I don't have the time to write all the reasons I love this brand or this flavor.
10_bj,2020-07-25,5,,very good ice cream flavor from the bunch in my opinion. i think the cream flavor is great and i love the chocolate covered cone pieces that is all over the cup. the price is good and you can find this at your local Walmart or Target for about $4 i like to have it with me on a spa night while i'm watching movies.
10_bj,2018-02-04,5,On my top 5 list,"I love the smoothness of the ice cream, the crunch of the cone and the yummy caramel swirl. Thank you for creating this flavor."
10_bj,2020-07-25,5,,"I normally only get Cherry Garcia from Ben & Jerrys, but I just tried this flavor out for the first time ever. This has all of my favorite things in it - chocolate, fudge, caramel and waffle cone bits! The waffle cone bits are my favorite little add on. They add a nice crunch to the ice cream. Highly recommend!"
10_bj,2020-04-25,5,,One of my favorite ice cream flavors. I love Stephen Colbert and its so cool that they collaborated with him on this! The flavors together are so delicious- Im not even a caramel fan but the overall flavor is just too good. And the chocolate covered waffle pieces are so unique to this ice cream and so tasty.
10_bj,2019-10-18,1,Not the best,I love Ben and jerry’s Ice cream but this flavor is just not it... It’s so boring tasting compared to most of the other choices they have
10_bj,2020-07-26,5,,"Ben & Jerry are my two favorite men because not only are they SMASHING the patriarchy, but theyve been killing the ice cream game for years. Americone dream is the perfect balance between the sweet cream I cream and the salty waffle cone pieces. Its not too indulgent and is always stocked in my fridge!"
10_bj,2020-01-26,5,,"I LOVE Stephen Colbert and I LOVE Americone dream! I am a total vanilla girl through and through and tell me that my vainlla has toffee, almonst, caramel and wafers? HEAVEN!!! This ice cream was made for ME but, since I love Stephen Colbert SO much I let Ben & Jerry name this one after him. Mwahahaha!"
10_bj,2017-06-14,5,Soulfullness,My favorite ice cream in this world! For a long time I've tried to find my favorite ice cream. My brother likes buying random ice creams and he ended up having this one night. I fell in LOVE! I feel this ice cream on a spiritual level! It defineitly fits who I am as a person! Crunchy and sweet! ; )
10_bj,2020-07-30,5,,im not the biggest fan of ice cream but THIIIIS is so good. I cant get over how amazing this is if im going to a drug store for snacks I always grab this. If you havent tried it please give it a try you wont regret it!! (plus this is an amazing company to support so please spend the extra money!)
10_bj,2020-08-29,3,Three Times This Has Been Offered to Me,"My husband has bought this for me three times and I've eaten it all three times. I was ""squinty"" two of those times so on those occasions, I was super thankful for it and likely licked the bowl. That said, I am not reviewing this also squinty and eating Cheetos that I also think are super awesome."
10_bj,2020-07-23,5,,"If I had to pick a favorite ice cream I think it would be this one. Yeah it would definitely be this one. Its just the best ice cream I dont know what else to say it has everything you could want it has chocolate covered waffle cone pieces, it has caramel, and it literally is the Americone dream."
10_bj,2020-07-28,5,,I am not a big ice cream person at all but we picked this flavor up so I gave it a try since it has been so hot out. It. Is. DELICIOUS. I now have a scoop every night - the caramel swirls and chunks of cone in the vanilla ice cream are insane. You can tell they are used high quality ingredients.
10_bj,2020-07-28,4,,I cannot tell you how much I love this ice cream! It is a flavor I always buy when buying ice cream. I cannot express how delicious this is and I think you should go out and buy a pint right now. Trust me. I love ice cream. I am super satisfied with my choice to eat this for dessert for years.
10_bj,2019-09-29,3,Just not for me,"I know a lot of people really love this one, but I'm not feeling it. The caramel swirl is delicious, but the cone pieces are soggy/chewy, and to me, they should be crunchy, like in a Drumstick treat. I think I'll be passing on this one in the future and trying the Karamel Sutra Core instead."
10_bj,2020-02-10,5,,This ice cream is one of my favorites right now!! The pieces of chocolate covered cones are so good. Also I love the caramel swirl throughout this ice cream. It's a little on the sweeter side but so creamy and delicious. I can't wait to get more of this. I just wish it was a little cheaper.
10_bj,2020-01-21,5,,This ice cream is one of my favorites right now!! The pieces of chocolate covered cones are so good. Also I love the caramel swirl throughout this ice cream. It's a little on the sweeter side but so creamy and delicious. I can't wait to get more of this. I just wish it was a little cheaper.
10_bj,2020-07-26,5,,This is my second favorite flavor of Ben & Jerrys. I love it so much and hope they never retire the flavor. Delicious sugar cone bits are the perfect crunch in the creamy ice cream. I only put a few sprinkles on top of this and it is the perfect dessert! Hard to not eat the whole pint...
10_bj,2020-07-29,2,,"This has to be my least favorite Ben & Jerrys flavor. Usually they knock it out of the park, but this one disappointed me. Its strangely...bland. The cone pieces seemed stale and cardboard-y, and the rest of the flavor didnt make up for the lack, unfortunately. I wont be buying it again."
10_bj,2020-04-16,5,,"When I want ice cream, this one is my GO TO. I love everything about it. Although the Tonight Dough is a close second, I prefer the Americone Dream. Its easy to find and the pint size is perfect for one serving for me! Nothing hits the spot when I am having a craving like this variety."
10_bj,2019-03-03,4,,This flavor is delicious!! I absolutely love the little pieces of waffle cone in there. I enjoy ben&jerrys the most out of all the other ice creams because its creamier than others.
10_bj,2020-07-23,5,,"This is my all-time favorite, vanilla with pockets of fudge and caramel, it is pricey but goes on bogo often where I shop. The tubs are small but that's a good thing otherwise brainfreeze and sweats or pj's (unless you have elastic waist pants) would be the norm. Perfect with Netfix."
10_bj,2020-07-25,5,,This icecream is so good. I like the chocolate covered waffle cone pieces and the swirls of caramel yummy . Its the perfect combination. Sometimes I eat the whole pint . Its thats good. Plus Ben & Jerry's is woke so im happy to support them. I will definitely continue to repurchase
10_bj,2020-07-24,5,,"My favorite ice cream! Taste just like a drum stick!! Has the perfect amount of flavor! Vanilla, milk chocolate and little bits of cone, just the perfect combination. I try not to go down the freezer section of the grocery store because I know I'm going to get a couple pints! Yum!!"
10_bj,2020-07-23,4,,Ben & Jerrys is a staple in the ice cream industry and i enjoy it. Its not my go to because it can be too rich a lot of times but this particular combination of flavors is classic and delicious. If i only had Ben & Jerrys to choose from this would be it! Gotta love the classics!
10_bj,2017-08-07,5,My favorite,"I am a long time lover of Americone Dream, delicious caramel and waffle cone flavors. I was surprised with my latest purchase to find cookies and cream ice cream instead of vanilla in the carton, in the end a not unwelcome addition. Perhaps brings into question quality control."
10_bj,2020-07-29,5,,"I love Ben and Jerrys as a company because of their social justice and community based causes. Americone Dream is one of my favorite flavors. Its the perfect mix of fudge, caramel and waffle cone pieces. Its rich and creamy. Beware, once you get started, its hard to put down!"
10_bj,2019-07-20,5,Simple Perfection,Since I was 13 I have never strayed from my two favs Phish Food and Chocolate brownie ... I saw waffle cone pieces and was sold. Americone dream is a great combination of flavors. The waffle pieces are still crisp and fresh. I ONLY wish it was loaded with more waffle pieces.

10_bj,2020-06-11,5,,"My go-to Ben and Jerrys! They have the best ice cream, and they always pack it full of amazing ingredients! They are all good, but this one is definitely my favorite. You cant go wrong with fridge covered waffle cone pieces with Carmel drizzle. Seriously the best!"
10_bj,2020-07-26,5,,"THIS IS MY FAVORITE ICE CREAM OF ALL TIME! Ben and Jerry's went crazy this falvor, and I love it. The mix of caramel, waffle cone, and vanilla is superb, and if you do anything next to the grocery store, you have to pick this up. I swear it will change your life."
10_bj,2020-07-26,5,,"This is one of my most favorite flavors when it comes to ice cream! I love that he has pieces of cone broken up in it! How creative is that!? This is the most bought ice cream flavor for me, but this is mostly because its only a few servings! Thats okay though!"
10_bj,2019-11-05,5,,"There will never be a bad time for ice cream. I LOVE Ben & Jerrys. Not only does the company actually stand for some pretty great things, theyre flavors are unbeatable!! Americone Dream is my favorite with crunchy little waffle cone pieces, chocolate, caramel!!"
10_bj,2020-04-08,4,,"This is so so good, but it's also so so expensive. The containers are so small that you split this between 2 people and you are done in one sitting. I do really love the different flavors swirling together in this one but I save Ben and Jerry's for emergencies."
10_bj,2019-04-03,5,,This brand is for certain my favorite brand. It is consistently good. This flavor is the best. Someone put me on it when I was in college and ever since I have been hooked. I also love how it is widely available. The names are pretty unique and I love that too.
10_bj,2019-07-17,4,"Delicious, but too much caramel sauce.","I love this flavor, however, the ones I have purchased in the last year had far too much caramel. It is not just swirls, but globs, which makes it all too sweet. The rest of the ice cream, especially the chocolate cover cone pieces, is great and well balanced."
10_bj,2018-11-23,5,,Ice cream is one of my favorite desserts and Ben and Jerry’s never lets me down. I’m not much of a vanilla person so all the bits and pieces and drizzles throughout the ice cream is great. It tastes delicious and there’s enough that it lasts me a few days too!
10_bj,2019-01-07,5,Love,We call this our honeymoon ice cream because it was what was being sampled during the factory tour we went on on our honeymoon. I’ve purchased a pint a month since then. The chocolate cone pieces seemed so weird at first but the flavors blend so perfectly.
10_bj,2018-10-24,5,,"Listen, my apartment is a Ben & Jerry's apartment. If I'm going for ice cream, my first grab is always B&J. Americone Dream, Chubby Hubby, Tonight Dough, Half-Baked. The list goes on. There's usually a pint in my freezer. What's not to love about it?"
10_bj,2017-09-10,5,Excellence,"The best flavor, hands down. Forever.
Ben and Jerry's is my #1 ice. It tastes super clean but never bland. I like the natural ingredient lists and the variety of flavors. Plus its just creamier and better than every other ice cream out there, hands down."
10_bj,2020-04-27,5,,as with most ben and jerrys products this is a masterful combination of texture flavor and scent. the smooth creaminess added with the crunch of the shells and the sweet smell of caramel give this flavor its sheer amazingness. definitely a favorite flavor
10_bj,2020-09-07,5,FAVORITE ICE CREAM,By far the best ice cream I have ever eaten! I have quite a sweet tooth so trust me when I say that this stuff is good! The caramel is in every bite of vanilla ice cream. The chocolate waffle cone is light and delightful! Please never discontinue this!!

10_bj,2020-07-24,5,,"My favorite Ben & Jerrys flavor! It has everything - cone, caramel, cookie dough. So good. Same price tag as all Ben & Jerrys but delicious enough to splurge. Also, as a person with a nut allergy there is no warning or may contain, which is relieving!"
10_bj,2019-06-23,1,Bummer,"I thought it was jimmy Fallon on the pint wanting to get the tonight dough. I was so upset when I got home. So I attempted to enjoy it. It’s not tasty at all. It’s salty, and crunchy & not what I want my ice cream to be."
10_bj,2017-06-23,5,Americone Suprise,"My wife brought me this one home to my disappointment as it really did not appeal to me. I thought it would not have any strong flavor, but I am glad I was wrong! Great mix-ins through out, a nice caramel taste and chewy bits of cone. Would buy again!"
10_bj,2019-06-24,4,,I really enjoy Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream varieties but do not often purchase them because of the high price tag. One of my favorites from Ben & Jerry's is Stephen Colbert's Americone Dream. I love the crunchy wafflecone bits mixed with all the goodness.
10_bj,2018-12-02,5,,"THE BEST ICE CREAM OUT THERE!!!! I love the chocolate covered wafers that give it an extra crunch and they go so well with the Carmel drizzle and vanilla ice cream. I buy this over and over again every time I have an ice cream craving, 10/10 recommend"

10_bj,2020-07-24,4,,I really enjoyed this ice cream. The ice cream itself was super smooth and didn't do that weird thing where it gets crystally when you put it back in the freezer. Plus it satisfied my craving for something crunchy thanks to the ice cream cone pieces!
10_bj,2020-01-12,5,,This is my favorite icecream and icecream brand ever. I love how they dont just sell chocolate or vanilla but these creative ones instead. The only thing i wish they did was sell bigger sizes. Its expensive for how small it is but totally worth it.
10_bj,2020-07-30,3,,"I really wanted to love this ice cream. Maybe its the hype? But I kind of had higher expectations. It was good, dont get me wrong!! I liked the sweet and the crunch and the chocolate... but Idk. Wouldnt call it my favorite of all time or anything."
10_bj,2019-01-07,3,Excellent mix of flavors,"Yes, 3 stars. I would have gave it 4 or 5 stars, but tonight dough raised the bar to high. After trying the amazing mix of flavors in tonight dough, no other flavor will be able to match the quality or complexity that I know expect from ice cream."
10_bj,2019-04-05,5,,B and j always wins in my book. Nothing is better than blue Bell but this always takes the cake. I love this brand so much and their ice cream is loaded! Better than any alternatives out there. Nothing taste like b&j. Super satisfied with this!!
10_bj,2020-04-02,5,,"Okay, i usually do not like vanilla or caramel, but this ice cream laughs at me. The waffle cone bits are worth it all. If thats all you get it for, its worth it. They are chocolatey, crunchy and the ice cream just goes so perfectly with it."
10_bj,2020-07-03,5,,This flavors has become one my of new favorite as my flavor of choice seems to ALWAYS be sold out. Its got a great mix of flavors that come together for a delicious taste. I generally only buy when the product is on sale as it is expensive.
10_bj,2020-06-19,5,,"I love this ice cream!! I prefer vanilla-based ice cream over chocolate, and this is my favorite B&J ice cream flavor. With waffle cone pieces and a chocolate swirl, this sweet treat is a rewarding dessert that will tickle your tastebuds."

10_bj,2020-07-30,5,,"This is one of my favorite flavors, I dont get it often. Partially because I cant find it and also because I dont tolerate dairy well. It is pricey as its Ben& Jerry but its also has all of the yummy flavors I remember from childhood!"
10_bj,2019-05-02,5,,Ben and Jerrys is the best ice cream! The Americone dream flavor is one of my favs because it has everything you could ever want in an ice cream right there in the pint. Its not too overbearing it has just enough of everything in it
10_bj,2020-05-07,5,,"By far my favorite ice cream by Ben & Jerry's!! This is such a great, never done before flavor that is provides that classic taste of a chocolate dipped cone. If you're debating which flavor to buy, you can't go wrong with this one."

10_bj,2020-07-24,5,,"My very favorite ice cream flavor! It is incredible including caramel ribbons, chunks of sugar cone, chocolate chips all mixed into vanilla. I only wish that it was slightly more affordable. I would eat it way more often if it was!"
10_bj,2020-07-24,4,,I love this Icecream! I love the fact that they have actual pieces of cone in the Icecream. I think its a little on the expensive side. I only buy that brand when they are on sale. Thats really the only negative thing I had to say.
10_bj,2020-07-25,3,,"I was not a fan of this particular flavor they have. The waffle cone pieces were stale, and it wasnt that great of a flavor. I didnt even finish my pint. I love a lot of other flavors they have, but this one I would not buy again."
10_bj,2020-07-30,5,,"This has to be my favorite flavor! Ive probably have brought more than 10 pints. This is the best ice cream created. It has vanilla, caramel, and waffle cone. Its just amazing! Please do yourself a favor and run to the store now!"
10_bj,2020-07-18,5,,"I love this flavor, the bits of cone add the perfect texture and the overall combo of flavors is great. I appreciate the support the company gives too, so it makes the ice cream all the sweeter. Plus Stephen Colbert is hilarious."

10_bj,2020-07-29,3,,Im a person who likes a lot of goodies in their ice cream. This flavor was a little bland for my personal taste and didnt seem to have as many fix-ins as other varieties do. It was an ok option but I would not purchase again.
10_bj,2020-07-31,5,,"My favorite ice cream of all time. This is the perfect combination of ice cream, swirls and chunks. But dont bother with the [product:ben-&-jerrys-americone-dream-pint-slices-ice-cream-9-ct] they are extremely disappointing."
10_bj,2020-07-19,5,,I love me some Americone Dream. The perfect treat at the end of the day. The crunchy waffle cone pieces inside are my favorite because they add a nice crunch to go along with the creamy ice cream and delicious caramel swirl!

10_bj,2020-01-22,5,PERFECTION,Literally the best ice cream ever. All the best ingredients. In my fantasy world half the Carmel would be replaced with pretzels but it’s perfect as is too. My stores don’t gave it enough but that’s ok. It’s a scarce luxury
10_bj,2019-03-03,5,,Best of is in this concoction of yummy! This is my go to and not only because I love Stephen Colbert but part of the proceeds go to charity. The mix of the cone in the ice cream with the chocolate just all around perfect

10_bj,2020-01-28,5,,One of my favorite Ben and Jerrys flavor! Not too sweet and the waffle pieces in there add a nice texture to the ice cream. Some ice creams have too much caramel or not enough but this is very well balanced!
10_bj,2018-10-03,5,,"Ben & Jerry’s has great flavors. I especially like this one because you don’t need to scoop it onto a cone, there are bits of cone in it already!! A bit expensive, but I get it on sale at CVS or Stop & Shop."
10_bj,2020-04-11,5,,This is my favorite. The only thing that makes it better is when I add my own slices of banana to it (I really like banana and icecream); but it's fantastic the way it is. My FAVORITE Ben and Jerry's flavor.

10_bj,2020-07-31,5,,The only ice cream I every get when Im craving some. It is sweet but its not overpowering like some other flavors and there arent a horrific amount of fillings. 11/10 ice cream with 20/10 political humor
10_bj,2018-09-13,5,,Love the cone pieces in this ice cream and the flavor is really good I find myself eating the whole carton which is dangerous but Ben and Jerry’s is always amazing and never a let down love this so much
10_bj,2020-07-31,4,,"A tasty treat! Not my favorite ice cream but a decent one to try. Plus Colbert! And chocolate! Best eaten straight out of the container with a spoon. Grab a pint, grab a best friend, and grab 2 spoons."

10_bj,2018-09-02,5,Just Right!,I am someone who does not care for desserts which are too chocolatey rich. Americone Dream is a perfect flavor balance for me. Sweet vanilla and caramel with just enough chocolate crunchy cone.

10_bj,2019-10-23,3,,This flavor gets the job done if youre wanting an ice cream cone without having to eat an actual ice cream cone. It is just a little too sweet for my liking (similar to how sugar free tastes).
10_bj,2020-01-12,5,,"This is my favorite flavor from Ben and Jerry! It taste amazing and definitely worth it. However because of the brand, a small pint is about $5 which is a bit expensive for such a small size."

10_bj,2020-07-29,5,,Probably one of my favorite ice cream flavors from Ben & Jerrys. Its definitely a classic!
10_bj,2020-07-23,5,,Love love love this classic! Im totally a vanilla girl and add some crunch ... Im in love!
10_bj,2020-01-07,5,,Great flavor. Love the chocolate and crunch of the waffle cone. I do think its expensive.
10_bj,2020-05-06,5,,I love ice cream and I love this flavor. I also love Ben and Jerrys. The taste is amazing
10_bj,2019-02-17,5,Yummy!,"This is by far my favorite flavor of Ben & Jerry's, always my go to when I get ice cream!"
10_bj,2020-07-26,5,,Who doesnt love the chocolate nugget in the bottom of an ice cream cone?!? Irresistible!
10_bj,2020-01-23,5,,BEST FLAVOR OF ICE CREAM. Chocolate covered waffle cone pieces?! Are you joking?! Unreal
10_bj,2018-07-29,5,AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,IS super yummy. and delish!! I bought this yesterday and I am so happy I did buy it pls
10_bj,2018-10-03,5,,I intake a ridiculous amount of ice cream a week hahah. Ben and jerry never disappoints
10_bj,2018-07-08,5,,Ice cream cone ice cream. Droooool. Ben & Jerry’s is the freaking best. Can’t beat it!
10_bj,2020-05-11,5,,love this product and its amazing quality recommend to everyone honestly - love it :).

10_bj,2019-02-04,4,,What more can I say about Ben & Jerrys that hasnt been said? Grab a pint and enjoy!
10_bj,2020-03-31,5,,This is my favorite go to ice cream!! I LOVE it!! I cant get enough of it!! Yummmmm
10_bj,2019-12-19,5,,This one is my favorite its so good and doesnt last long around my house its perfect

10_bj,2020-03-28,5,,Its very good and I love this ice cream and its sooooo good and I highly recommend
10_bj,2020-06-22,5,,"This is the best. Ben & Jerrys is the best. And if you dont like it, youre wrong."
10_bj,2020-01-20,4,Good but could be better....,Would be a million times better with fudge swirl with/instead of the caramel.
10_bj,2019-07-28,5,My favorite,I've never been much of an ice cream eater but I crave this one all the time!
10_bj,2018-02-11,5,All time favorite,"There are a lot of great flavors, but in my opinion this is the best."
10_bj,2020-06-07,5,The Absolute Best,Yummy! Now can you please make a vegan version...pretty please
10_bj,2018-05-07,5,Delicious,It’s so good. Thank you Ben. Thank you Jerry. Thank you!
10_bj,2019-10-13,5,"So good, under rated at 4.5, outrageous.","I would eat it everyday if I could, and sometimes I do."
10_bj,2018-05-07,4,Syd527,I really love this flavor. It’s simple but really good
10_bj,2018-04-26,5,Simply in Love!,Love this ice cream and adore Colbert!! Really tasty!
10_bj,2020-07-18,3,There's a better choice,This is distinctly inferior to Vanilla Caramel Fudge
11_bj,2017-08-08,5,Tastes just like pecan pie!,My husband and I loved this ice cream! The subtle bourbon flavor with the pecan chunks was superb!
11_bj,2017-07-14,5,Love this!,"This flavor is amazing! I've only found one store in my area that sells it and I stock up. I've never been a huge pecan ice cream fan before, but I really can't get enough of this one."
11_bj,2017-12-06,5,Best of both worlds!,Being from southwest Louisiana we love our pecan pie and ice cream. This ice cream has all the flavor of the south. Always heartbreaking when the store is out of their limited stock of it. Please ship it to my house all year long lol
11_bj,2017-05-22,5,So tasty,"I love this ice cream! The first bite always tastes sweet with a hit of bourbon, then add in the nuts, and the short bread, and you have delicious complexity, with a nice crunch."
11_bj,2018-11-04,5,My favorite!,"I love love love this ice cream! It's got a great balance of flavors and textures, and the hints of bourbon are just right. I would eat this all day, every day, if I could get away with it."
11_bj,2018-02-12,5,Southern Style Ice Cream,Bourbon Pecan Pie Ice Cream can't get enough. The bourbon makes the ice cream.
11_bj,2020-02-23,5,Yee Haw!,Excellent ice cream! Whiskey can sometimes overpower all the ingredients--this ice cream has a great balance of flavor and the whiskey is not to overpowering. Here is the problem--I bought this ice cream in an outlet store in California so I fear that Bourbon Pecan Pie will be in the Ben & Jerry flavor grave yard soon. It was a great flavor while it lasted though.
11_bj,2018-01-15,1,Disappointing bourbon pecan pie ice cream,I absolutely HATE this ice cream I thought they brought bake SOUTHERN PECAN PIE!!!! That's why I bought this bourbon mess it's not even close to being as good as the southern pecan pie ice cream I'm from Dallas Tx I know pecan pie when I taste it this ice cream didn't do it for me I will be returning it way too much Carmel in the ice cream it's self I've had better Ben and jerrys ice cream
11_bj,2020-03-01,5,One of my top two favorites,"This is one of my top two favorite flavors from B&J, and the other is long gone (the late, lamented Wavy Gravy)."
12_bj,2018-01-23,5,Very Impressed,I love Brewed to Matter! So thing about the coffee ice cream mixed with brownie batter and chocolate chunks does it for me. Although I am worried with it being a exclusive flavor it may be discontinued. Please keep this in the Ben and Jerry’s line up!
12_bj,2020-03-24,2,Unbalanced and disappointing,"I can see that the inspiration for this flavor came from a fancy coffee drink like a frozen mocha or Frappuccino. However the balance of flavors & textures is off for my taste. There's not enough coffee flavor. The coffee flavor would be improved by using the cold brew method instead of coffee extract. The extract brings an unpleasant aftertaste. The chocolate chunks are too big and dominating. There's not enough brownie swirl and it's not as prominent of ""brownie"" flavor or texture as in other pints. While this flavor idea is good, I think the execution definitely needs to be adjusted. I still love Ben & Jerry's! I'm just not a fan of this pint."
12_bj,2017-04-20,5,The perfect flavor,"Okay Ben and Jerry's, you can stop making new flavors. This one is perfect."
12_bj,2018-04-05,5,Perfect,My girlfriend isn't a fan of this and I think that she is so wrong in every regard that I am writing this review just out of spite and also because this is the perfect ice cream and deserves all of the stars.
12_bj,2017-10-30,5,Best flavor on the planet,"This is by far my favorite flavor, of all time. A decade ago, brownie batter was a flavor that was available as pints and I would get that and eat around the fudge brownie chunks because it was worth it. But this flavor is everything. Please never stop making this flavor! It is the end all be all of flavors. Thank you so much for making this ice cream!!"
12_bj,2017-08-31,5,Amazing,"I bought this flavor one time at Target because it was the closest one to a java chip flavor, and it changed my life. It was so good. I searched up and down for it though and couldn't find it for a few months in any other store, and since then had moved. I just found it tonight in another target location and jumped for joy in the store. My favorite ice cream flavor by far! Wish it came in a bigger size..."
12_bj,2018-04-12,5,My All Time Favorite,"I absolutely love this flavor. It is beyond perfect and no other flavor can even begin to compare! Unfortunately, it is an exclusive flavor only sold at Target. I’ll buy 2 or 3 when I find them in stock. I will go out of my way to go to target specifically for this flavor and 4 out of 5 times, they are out of the flavor. And the stock guy told me that there isn’t any on order and none coming with the next delivery. Can anybody please help!"
12_bj,2019-12-26,5,Have never love Ice cream so much,I absolutely love this flavor! I have never loved a flavor as much as brewed to matter. My son loves it as well. As someone mentioned before I can only purchase at 1 store and I ask at all the other stores that are closer to order it. I never have seen it at those stores. But we absolutely LOVE THIS ONE!!!!!
12_bj,2020-03-26,5,So Have a Pint of Ice Cream and Catch Your Breath,"I should heed my own advice because this flavour truly took my breath away. Coffee ice cream is my all-time, hands-down favourite type of ice cream that is reliably available. Coffee ice cream with chocolate syrup to be specific. So this pint? It does it all for me man. It does all of the heavy lifting, it unscrews the jar lids that are on too tight, and it even pumps my gas for me when it's raining out. I didn't even need to think about exerting an iota of effort to get the flavour profile of this pint exactly where I wanted it. Didn't even need to turn location services on. A++"
12_bj,2018-10-02,4,Yum,"Nothing wrong here! Yummy coffee ice cream base and a great tasting fudge swirl. The chocolate chunks are a good addition. Not my favorite flavor (I mean, how many favorites can someone have?) but definitely yummy and satisfying if you’re craving coffee and fudge flavors!"
12_bj,2018-07-16,4,Reminds me of mocha,I really liked this coffee flavor! I have tried a few of the other coffee flavors and this one is probably my favorite! There was plenty of brownie swirl and fudge chunks that paired really well with the coffee ice cream! I would definitely try this flavor again!
12_bj,2018-06-17,5,Best flavor of all Time,I love coffee ice cream and I usually by a store brand one called java chunk that is similar but once I tried brewed to matter I'll never go back. I love everything about it and I hope it never goes away please tell me this is going to stick around!!!!!
12_bj,2018-08-26,5,My new favorite!,So my favorite ice cream flavor has always been coffee. But my favorite Ben and Jerry’s flavor has always been chocolate fudge brownie. This ice cream brings favorites together! Please make this a permanent fixture in the Ben and Jerry’s line up!
12_bj,2018-01-03,5,Draws us to Target,A wonderful coffee and chocolate ice cream with a nice mix of flavors and textures. We shop at Target sometimes just because that's the only place we can get it. Our favorite B&J flavor since Toffee Heath Bar Crunch went away.
12_bj,2018-03-29,5,The most perfect ice cream.,I make up reasons to go to Target to get this ice cream. It is simply perfect. I keep thinking it will get old and I will switch to my other favs. But I just.... never.... do.
12_bj,2018-12-28,5,AMAZINGGGG!,A coffee and chocolate lovers dream in ice cream form. Coffee flavor infuses your mouth as decadent chocolate chunks deliver a dessert worthy of all your money! Love it!
12_bj,2019-02-06,5,the indisputable CHAMP,"let me start by saying that i've literally never written an internet review in my life, but this stuff is so good that here i am, pleading ben & jerry's to never discontinue this flavor... i've been loyal to b&j's for many years but never have i been so loyal to a single pint before. this incredible combo of coffee and brownie batter plagiarized straight from my DANG DREAMS. honestly i should take y'all to court for stealing my heart. brewed to matter 4evr."
12_bj,2018-05-27,4,Easily in my top 3 favorites,This flavor is my go to at my local Target. Recently the past 3 times I bought this flavor there is very little brownie batter and an abundance of fudge chucks. Which is disappointing because the brownie batter is the best part!
12_bj,2019-02-07,5,Coffee? Fudge Yes!,"This is just a really great flavor! Ben and Jerry’s does the best coffee ice cream base flavors of brand available and this is no exception. The fudge flakes taste great and give a textural contrast to the smooth, creamy ice cream. The brownie-fudge is, of course, delicious and completes a perfect pint. If you like coffee and fudge then take a trip over to Target and grab a pint or 4."
12_bj,2018-12-14,5,Literally my new favorite!,"Just found this in my local target, and while I already had 3 other pints in my freezer of other flavors at home, I needed to try this one because it has everything I love in it. Needless to say, it did not disappoint and I can't wait to make another trip to target to get more of this delicious flavor."
12_bj,2020-08-24,5,Oh em geeeee!!!!,"As a dedicated Ben and Jerry’s customer and ice cream aficionado, this ice cream flavor ranks above all others; supreme. You must, must, try this!
The balance of coffee and chocolate is unparalleled. I will continue to search high and low in the mid-Atlantic region for this flavor."
12_bj,2019-01-03,5,The BEST Coffee Flavor Ice Cream EVER!,"I've only recently been able to find this flavor in the Midwest. It is the absolute best mixture of coffee and chocolate. I'm a little worried because it seems to be disappearing from there shelves at TARGET w/o being restocked, and I hope this isn't so."
12_bj,2019-06-14,5,One of my favorite flavors!,"I tried this for the first time last night, and I was pleasantly surprised! The coffee taste and the fudge chunks were especially nice and delicious. I would say that this pint is one of my favorite flavors now! Also, sponsor me pls"
12_bj,2017-07-26,5,OMCoffee!!!!,Yesss!!! Finally a coffee ice cream with delicious mixins!!! I'm giving it 5 stars bc its the best flavor you've got even though it would be better with cookie dough instead of brownie batter!!
12_bj,2019-04-18,5,best ice cream ever!,I love love love this new flavor! The coffee is perfect and the brownie batter swirl and fudge chunks really take it up to the next level! I really hope this exclusive flavor is staying!
12_bj,2018-05-30,5,Good Stuff,"I think this flavor, which was my all time favorite about 25 years ago, use to be Cappacino Commotion. But I'm not certain. But I do know for sure that this stuff is good!"
12_bj,2018-11-15,5,Best ice cream ever,This is now my favorite ice cream to buy a the grocery! The only thing that would make this better would be chocolate sandwhich cookie crumbles :)
12_bj,2017-07-23,5,Yum!,Reminds me of the old Vermonty Python flavor sold years ago. Perfect combination of flavors. Definitely a keeper!
12_bj,2018-03-26,5,FANTASTIC!,My favorite flavor ever! I tell all my friends & family to try it. I've even eaten it for breakfast.
12_bj,2019-05-29,5,Love Coffee,Perfect balance of coffee and chocolate swirl <3 . Please donot discontinue !
12_bj,2017-10-30,5,AMAZING,Search no more for thE. Best. Ice. Cream. EVER.
12_bj,2017-09-20,5,Coffee Ice cream lover,Best coffee flavor from Ben & Jerry. Wish they make more coffee flavors
12_bj,2018-05-28,4,Yummy,"Very tasty! Add some chopped almonds, and we'd have perfection!"
12_bj,2018-04-20,5,Love,this flavor tops all other ben and jerry flavors no doubt
12_bj,2018-06-26,3,Le Sigh...,"Welp, I finally broke down and bought this flavor that I've often seen mentioned on the site(wasn't quite in my usual buying locales til recently). And figured since a friend of mine told me how awesome she found this flavor or I think another coffee flavor by B&J's to be really great. I figured I would give it a whirl and try it as a ""breakfasty"" sort of option for a change. I mean it has coffee in it right? Figured it would perk me up a bit more before work. Add in the chocolate and sugar in general, I figured I would be good to go. But unfortunately I was wrong. The coffee flavor wasn't quite as strong(save for on 2/3's of the top of the pint, to the point of me not being able to tell if the fudge pieces were plain fudge flavor or expresso flavored), even appreciated the thinner fudge pieces. But hardly got any of the brownie swirl flavor until I was a 1/4 of the way done with the pint. Not to mention, after consuming a good half of the pint before work, I would have thought I'd have some get up and go(which I tend to get in general off of coffee flavored ice creams). But I had a good 10 to 15 min bit of pep before I crashed and wanted to nap so hard even before I left the house. So in other words, me thinks this flavor is going to be a no can do for me in the future. And would recommend it to folks that like coffee flavored ice creams you can eat at night and still get a good night's rest afterward."
13_bj,2019-02-02,2,Could be amazing.,"The cheese cake ice creams could be amazing, but for some reason the one thing wrong with the ice cream is the cheesecake balls. The balls taste very chemical and just not right. Overall I scooped around them. While the carmel flavor really lacked in this ice cream, and the chocolate cookie swirl was very little and almost nonexistent. I am very disappointed with how all of the cheesecake truffles have turned out. Overall, the truffles ruin the ice cream and need to be reformulated. While I am disappointed that this ice cream lacked swirl and Carmel. What could be amazing, was ruined by lack of and truffles."
13_bj,2020-05-29,2,Flavor's okay but..,"The flavors work for the most part. Ben & Jerry's ice creams with the graham cracker swirl are my personal favorites but this one left much to be desired. My main problem are the truffles, in this flavor in particular. The truffles seem to be frozen until you bite into them and then it's soft. I can't really enjoy the truffles if I'm too worried about the cold shock to my gums from parts of the ice cream being unexpectedly frozen in random places. I'm used to thinks like strawberries in the cheesecake to be frozen, but then something like the truffles that should be soft like the cookie dough is frozen, I can't really enjoy it."
13_bj,2018-06-11,3,Like everything but the cheesecake truffles,"First of all, let me just say that I love this truffle craze that has been going on and made a point to try every option. For this flavor, I love mostly everything about this: the ice cream, the swirls, the exterior of the truffles. However, I do not like the cheesecake interior of the truffles. The cheesecake flavoring is already there through the ice cream, but the cheesecake part of the truffles does not retain the coldness of the ice cream and doesn't fit. I think a chocolate interior would have probably worked better. Would not buy again unless I felt the desire to eat everything but the truffle."
13_bj,2020-04-17,4,Redemption!,"I feel like this remake of the old cheesecake truffle flavor totally snuck in under the radar--and a shame, because it's such an upgrade! Where the truffles were the downfall of the old version (no offense, Ben & Jerry), the new cheesecake pieces are exactly what I look for in a cheesecake ice cream mix-in. They're not liquidy and greasy like the truffles, but actually have a fluffy chew to them, and they taste great! A couple pieces even had a toasty crust on them. On the downside, the cookie crumble swirls were really thin, but I *almost* didn't even mind, because I came for the cheesecake on this one, and I got it!"
13_bj,2019-07-03,1,Definitely misses the mark.,"I bought this tonight for my mom and I. I couldn’t eat it. It’s some of the worst flavored ice cream I have had. The cookie crumbs do taste like cooking crumbs, gritty and all. The caramel flavor is very light barely there. The cheesecake truffle pieces are terrible. I love cheesecake, I bake wonderful cheesecakes, I hate the no bake style of cheesecake but these truffles are worse than that. They taste like someone took ice milk and mixed a dash a cream cheese in it. I was sorely disappointed. My mom did not enjoy it either. I have not idea what I am going to do with the stuff now but I’m certainly not going to eat it."
13_bj,2018-01-16,5,This ice cream is everything,Wow this ice cream is so delicious .. I will definitely be buying more
13_bj,2018-07-03,5,Carmel Chocolate Cheesecake,"First time trying it yesterday.. a little embarrassed to admit i""m definitely going to buy another as soon as I'm out of work today! So much flavor but not too sweet, the truffles covered in gram crackers have to be my favorite part"
13_bj,2019-07-03,2,Boring,"See, here is my issue: if I’m going to spend 1200 calories in one sitting on ice cream (and we all eat the whole pint) after working hard to burn enough calories to eat it, I want to melt at the first bite and feel the euphoria with every spoonful, and SO many Ben and Jerry’s flavors do that for me. But when a flavor is just ok, there is no way I’m going to eat it. There was nothing wrong really, with this flavor but I found the ice cream grainy and the flavor boring, and the truffles just didn’t do it for me. I LOVE Ben and Jerry’s, the pints are my favorite ways to spend my calories but I can’t justify eating a boring one. My wife liked it well enough but she wasn’t wowed either. I remember my first bites of Phish Food, Half Baked, one sweet world and so many others that just made me melt into a pool of euphoric joy and that’s what I need from my pints."
13_bj,2018-05-27,5,Amazing!,Soooooo good! Cookie bits are good! Cheesecake bites are good!
13_bj,2018-04-07,5,BEST FLAVOR,This is the best flavor ben and Jerrys has ever come out with.
13_bj,2018-04-14,4,The best of the truffle lineup.,"Fantastic flavor. The caramel addition to the cheesecake base makes it stand out far more than B&J's other cheesecake flavors. That flavor is made even stronger by the cheesecake truffles. The graham cracker and cookie crumbs complement each other perfectly, and the overall flavor is accurate to the real thing. Thank goodness the best cheesecake flavor is not a limited batch."
13_bj,2019-06-09,5,Like nothing you've ever tasted,"I don't know HOW anybody could hate on this icecream, it's the best thing that's ever happened! The cheesecake bits are creamy that literally melt in your mouth, the icecream is like no basic flavor that you've ever had, and the cookie bits pull it all together to ensure you never get a boring bite! My absolute FAVORITE flavor, never change Ben & Jerry's"
13_bj,2018-10-14,5,My new favorite!,I have been buying this one every single time I get Ben and Jerrys. I have probably bought it a good 20 times. The first time i don't think I liked it because it had a weird flavor but it really grew on me. I don't think it taste like caramel or cheesecake at all I really don't know what it taste like exactly but I love the cookie swirl and those balls I love them theu don't taste like cheesecake either and can't even describe what they do taste like it's like they made a really weird but awesome flavor but put it in the wrong container. Love it though I hope they don't discontinue.
13_bj,2018-08-09,3,Review Echo - Loved all but the CheeseCake Truffel,"I am going to completely echo the review of kuroyuuki below. This ice-cream is lovely, the cookie crumbles are nice and sweet, the caramel is perfectly subtle. The Cheese Cake Truffles, however, are almost sour in contrast. Unlike most ice cream ""goodies"" that I dig for (i.e. cookie dough chunks, brownie bits), I find myself trying to spoon around the cheese cake."
13_bj,2018-09-10,2,Cheesecake truffles taste...tastless?,"I purchased this ice cream hoping to find a replacement for Cheesecake Brownie since Ben and Jerry's is discontinuing that flavor. I am famous for finishing their pints in one sitting (I know, I am grossly unhealthy). Anyhow, I got through half the pint and had to throw the rest away. Very disappointing."
13_bj,2018-05-09,5,Amazing Ben and Jerry never fails me,"This is an ice cream I have been waiting to have I always felt I had to choose between strawberry cheesecake, American dream and cookie core, but now I have this! Rich flavor and extremely generous with cheesecake and cookie ratio. It is so smooth! This will forever be my go to ice cream and flavor"
13_bj,2018-06-25,2,Disappointing,The cheesecake bits tasted weird? Almost tasteless. The other truffle flavor is much better. I ended up throwing the rest of this pint away because I didn’t wanna waste the calories on it.
13_bj,2018-06-25,3,Overall good taste,"I recently bought this flavor and was most looking forward to the graham cracker/cheesecake truffle. However, I was highly disappointed with the flavor of the truffle. The ice cream itself tastes a lot like cheesecake, but the pieces themselves do not. I’ve had the strawberry cheesecake flavor before, and those cheesecake pieces, from what I remember, tastes how I feel these pieces should as well. Not sure if I would rebuy, but I’m glad I at least tried it."
13_bj,2019-08-27,2,Bad tasting cheesecake truffles,"The cheesecake truffles have a horrible taste, they almost taste like plastic. I had to eat around them! Ben & Jerry’s what happened to your awful tasting cheesecake truffles, everything else was delicious!"
13_bj,2019-07-05,1,Did not meet expectations,The flavor made this a must try for me. I was sorely disappointed. The cookie swirls were the only thing I could taste. The truffles had no flavor and the caramel cheesecake flavor was barely noticeable.
13_bj,2018-06-14,5,a perfect iced cream flavor for any human,"scientists have tried for thousands of years to create the best flavor of ice cream. now, with Ben & Jerry's Caramel Chocolate Truffles ice cream, those scientists can sleep easy. ben or jerry should delete any review that isnt 5/5 stars or higher."
13_bj,2018-06-14,1,A spoonful of disappointment,"I bought this flavor like 30 minutes ago because ya girl is hungry asf and had just cried for 2 hours. I love the Salty Caramel Core to death but sadly, Publix was out. But a sad attempt to substitute my caramel craving, I bought this piece of garbage. This doesn’t even taste like caramel, cheesecake, or chocolate. It is a hot mess of a flavor and I could do without. I truly expected more and I am still craving caramel, sad to say that every spoonful brought me closer to tears from disappointment."
13_bj,2020-05-16,5,Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake Truffles,This ice cream is the best thing I’ve ever spent my money on. It is perfect in every way and each component works beautifully together. I know for a fact I will never find another ice cream better than this one. I buy a pint at least once a month(I would buy more often if the calories weren’t so high)! I often eat the whole thing at once because it’s so good. I also have a tree-nut allergy which makes it extremely difficult if not impossible to find fun ice cream flavors I can eat and this one is safe! It’s definitely a must try!!
13_bj,2019-01-28,1,Poor execution,This sounds more delicious than it actually is. The cheesecake bites don’t taste anything like cheesecake. I wish I could have my money back.
13_bj,2018-04-08,3,Eh it’s okay,"I had to try this because I love cheesecake ice cream! The flavor of the icecream itself with the cookies is amazing! But honestly, the cheesecake bites ruined it for me. They just taste like balls of butter. They are not good at all. If those were changed this would probably be my favorite. Think about it Ben & Jerrys."
13_bj,2018-04-20,1,Ewwww,My absolute favorite flavor is the strawberry cheesecake so I was so excited to try the chocolate cheesecake. I was so very disappointed to find that it was really just cookies n cream ice cream with little chunks of lard covered in graham dust.
13_bj,2018-03-06,4,Excellent flavor,"The ice cream flavor and cookie swirl is phenomenal, but the cheesecake truffles in my pint had no flavor, which was disappointing. There weren’t very many truffles in the pint, however, so I couldn’t even complain much about them."
13_bj,2020-03-17,1,Used to be amazing!,"This flavor WAS the most amazing thing I'd ever put in my mouth. BUT they changed the cheesecake bits and now its just not good anymore. It makes me so sad, I had FINALLY found my emotional crutch! Now, I have nothing again :("
13_bj,2018-09-08,4,Bomb except..,This ice cream is delicious but the truffles are gross kinda...they’re very cheesy and sour in an odd way. make them less cheesy or something and add way more chocolate cookie and this ice cream will be perfect
13_bj,2020-09-16,5,This is the first new flavor I have really liked!,"I thought this ice cream was delicious. I do see how some people wouldn't like the cheesecake bites because they are tart compared to the ice cream. The base tastes more like a rich vanilla than caramel but I found it to be very tasty. If B&J changes the cheesecake bites they will have more satisfied consumers. I'll just keep buying it until they discontinue it. With the exception of Americone Dream, Peanut Butter Cup, and Cherry Garcia every time I love a flavor they discontinue it."
13_bj,2020-01-29,5,My favorite flavor EVER!,"I ALWAYS keep this stocked in my freezer! Please don't ever discontinue it!! Has all of my favorite things all in one ice cream- cheesecake, caramel & chocolate cookie. SO delicious!!"
13_bj,2020-06-11,1,The flavor isn’t the same!,"I used to be obsessed with this flavor! I used to buy it 3-4 times a week! Then the stores stopped carrying it for a while and now I recently noticed target has it in stock but the cheesecake pieces are no longer covered in graham cracker and the the flavor just isnt the same. This was the only flavor ice cream I would buy, and it was totally worth every calorie. Unless they change it back to their old version, I unfortunately won’t be buying it. PLEASEEEEEEE MAKE IT THE WAY IT WAS!!"
13_bj,2018-09-15,5,Nirvana,"No matter what the day, you will always find Ben & Jerry's pints in my freezer. I am always up for trying the new flavors and was excited to see this one at our grocery store. I mean caramel, chocolate, and cheesecake truffles...Come On! How can you not give the nod to this one? It has become one of my favorite flavors and obviously that of others as well since the quantities are always the most limited in the freezer case. Keep up the great work with the crazy good flavors!"
13_bj,2019-03-07,2,Meh,"The icecream is nice but gets samey after a while. The “truffles” are not pleasant.
I actually threw away around 1/3 of the tub..."
13_bj,2018-05-13,5,So good,"Love love love this flavor. One of my new favorites, my only criticism would be that I wish there was more graham cracker in it."
13_bj,2019-12-18,5,The only ice cream I will ever eat!!!,I have tried so many different brands and flavors of ice cream and I can honestly say This is hands down the best ice cream I have ever had in my life! The flavors are so perfect in every way and compliment eachother so well! I dont understand why Walmart & target near me stopped carrying it! I have been craving it so bad and refuse to eat anything else. I really liked cinnamon buns before trying this flavor and they dont sell that anymore either!! PLEASE BRING IT BACK!!!
13_bj,2018-04-11,5,Surprisingly good,I was a bit concerned there would be to much going on but honestly really solid. The cheesecake bites are very nice
13_bj,2018-05-30,4,Flavor is good!,"The flavor and texture of the ice cream itself, but the cheesecake pieces are too hard and not up to par."
13_bj,2020-02-14,5,BEST ICE CREAM EVER!,I ate some of this 2 days ago OMG one of the best ice cream flavors I’ve ever had- IN MY LIFE.
13_bj,2018-10-11,1,Truffle no,No crazy about cheese cake bites and the rest ok prefer other flavors
13_bj,2020-02-12,3,Didn't Get What I Was Expecting,"Long story short:
- cheesecake tastes weird, reminds me of some dairy free, coconut based cream cheese substitutes I've had, really needs revision
- graham cracker around the cheesecake is really good and adds good contrast in texture and flavor! wish there was more of it
- the cookie ""swirl"" I guess is a swirl because the cookie is swirled into the ice cream but its SOOOOOOOOO THIN. I was expecting a thick cookie swirl that I could pick out cookie chunks from. really disappointing because the cookies were so good!
- ice cream i guess slightly reminded me of butterscotch/caramel? if I was blindfolded and tried it I would probably think it's vanilla. it is very tasty though"
13_bj,2019-04-07,1,Cheesecake bites are bad,"I usually love Ben and Jerry's, but this ice cream was so bad that I'm writing my first ice cream review. The ice cream itself is not good, but the cheesecake bites are awful. They taste so fake and gross. I'm sad to say all of this because Ben and Jerry's is usually great, but I feel like I owe it to Ben and Jerry to tell the truth."
13_bj,2020-01-07,5,The BEST,"After One Love stopped restocking, I didn’t think it was possible I would find another flavor to top it. But then I tried this. It is the absolute BEST flavor. Everything in it mixes perfectly together, and the cheesecake bites are melt in your mouth amazing. The only complaint I have is it’s been so hard to find anywhere near me. I’ve traveled to outside towns looking for this flavor with no luck. Please restock this is southwest Missouri!!!"
13_bj,2019-05-09,2,"Disappointed in ""cheesecake""","I'm just now dipping into Ben and Jerry's to find a favorite flavor. Based on the package description, I should have loved this. The caramel ice cream was a bit bland and could have been vanilla. The chocolate swirl was nice, and I would have enjoyed even more graham cracker. The ""cheesecake"" truffles were a real problem for me, tasting mostly of coconut oil. I'm going to continue my sampling, but the cheesecake flavors are out."
13_bj,2018-06-24,5,I skip all meals for this!,"Oh my goodness, I'm so hooked on this flavor that I'd rather eat this than dinner. I'm almost glad it goes so fast at the stores near me so I don't eat it so often... The cheesecake truffles in this are delicious and the caramel is not overwhelming, it's subtle but just the perfect combination!"
13_bj,2019-10-19,5,Best flavor ever,"This is the best icecream flavor I've ever had hands down! My husband has bought me atleast 10 pints because I've never had a icecream I love more and now I cant find it anywhere in my town. Makes me so sad. I'm craving it and I need it back in my life. Best flavor ever Ben & Jerry's, please never take this one away & please make it more available. Gilmer Texas to be exact. This is a winner"
13_bj,2019-03-17,1,My least favorite flavor I have tried,The name sounded like something I would love. There was nothing chocolatey or caramelish about it. The cheesecake bites tasted like rotten milk. Not sweet at all. I definitely do not recommend this flavor.
13_bj,2018-05-10,5,The best flavor ever!!!,So I eat a couple pints of Ben and Jerry’s per night usually and I have to say that this is probably my favorite flavor! It’s soooo cheesecakey and amazing. Please make this flavor forever :-)
13_bj,2020-09-10,5,Best Ice Cream Ever,I've eaten a lot of ice cream in my time and I've never had a favorite until now. This is the best ice cream i have ever had. The cheesecake bites are actually big sized piece and there aren't too many to over power the ratio. The three flavor just mix so perfectly together. I say if you like cheesecake and caramel you better go try this delicious flavor. BEST ICE CREAM EVER!
13_bj,2019-07-27,2,That's NOT Cheesecake!,"On the bright side, the ice cream was great. I would try other flavors with the same base."
13_bj,2018-05-06,4,Good!,"Enjoyed this flavor. Caramel cheesecake ice cream is smooth, extremely tasty, and both flavors are prominent. The cookie swirls are just as awesome as they are in tonight dough. The truffles were good and the cheesecake flavor was good, but the truffles did not add or take away anything. I didn't deem them necessary in this particular pint, but it is still a great flavor."
13_bj,2020-02-07,5,Super good! Buying again!,I just got this ice cream yesterday and it’s already gone! I really enjoyed the overall flavors. Very creamy and not over powering. It didn’t give me any gas problems(lactose intolerant). The only downer about the ice cream was the little white balls of cheesecake( wish it was a little sweet) but overall super good ice cream. I think it’ll be one of my favorites!
13_bj,2018-11-19,1,Cheesecake bits taste funny,Wish I could say I liked this but the cheesecake bits had such an off flavor did not taste like cheesecake at all. Disappointed.
13_bj,2018-12-03,4,Excellent not too sweet balance!,"Hubs brought this home when Americone Dream was out. I was skeptical because I don't love things super sweet. This was PERFECT! Varied textures (although it lacks a CRUNCH but thats ok) with lightly changing flavors. Not over powering sweet, I enjoyed the cheesecake pieces and like others could use a touch more of the graham but I will no doubt get again."
13_bj,2019-01-28,5,Best icream flavor to date!,"I accidentally bought this at my local cvs one night and saw it was new, so said “I love cheesecake, why not?” WOW Saddened to not find it in the store again but never in my life have I seached online to see where I can find an icecream flavor (lol) and this has inspired me to do just that! Another level delicious, hope this stays around!"
13_bj,2020-08-16,4,Good in theory,"The cookie swirl and ice cream base is delicious, the cheesecake, like everyone else has said, is not. Frozen cheesecake barely has any flavour and let’s be honest, cheesecake isn’t that good to begin with. If the cheesecake was replaced with cookie dough and a salted caramel swirl was added this would be the best ice cream... like ever."
13_bj,2019-05-06,5,Omgsh! Instantly became a favorite,Purchased this flavor on a whim last night. Decided to taste it today & just like that I am a fan & will absolutely repurchase! I would like a little more cheesecake bites in the mix (because I enjoyed it so much) but I love the unique combination & how the flavors complement each other nonetheless. This one is definitely a keeper!
13_bj,2018-06-19,5,Yes. Yes. Yes.,"This new flavor is amazing. I don't buy ice cream from the grocery store often. My all time favorite has been the turtle sundae from a local place or two, and not much can top it. Occasionally I buy a B&J pint and have found a few I really like, like salted caramel core. This new flavor has possibly risen to the top of the list."
13_bj,2018-07-03,2,Coconut oil overpowers,The overwhelming coconut oil flavor in the cheesecake truffles made this flavor unpleasant overall. I enjoyed the cookie swirl but the fake caramel cheesecake flavor of the base ice cream was also not great. If it had been a more simple base flavor & no coconut oil in the truffles this could have been a solid flavor.
13_bj,2020-06-04,5,So GOOD!,I was recommended this ice cream by a friend a few weeks ago and have been obsessed with it! I'm not at all ashamed to admit I have eaten at least 4 or 5 pints since then and its my new favorite flavor. The ice cream is light and sweet and the cookie swirl adds a nice crunch. Would definitely recommend!
13_bj,2019-04-05,4,Needs more truffles!!!,I bought one a month ago for the second time and it was cheesecake chocolate swirl after truffle after truffle greatness. Sadly I bought some recently and could hardly find any on the ones I bought but I could deny the cheesecake flavor you guys excel at. Love it!!!
13_bj,2019-07-26,5,Delicious,I buy this icecream every saturday as my cheat treat i don’t crave nothing else but this icecream and its just the perfect combination of cheesecake and icecream. I try to buy other flavors they are delicious but this one is hard not to buy and enjoy.
13_bj,2020-08-31,3,I'm Eating it Now,I'm eating it now and I haven't stopped. I do think it could taste more authentically like cheesecake AND also caramel...oh wait...I just bit into a cheesecake bite and now I do think it tastes pretty much just like cheesecake...cool...cool...
13_bj,2019-07-26,5,Best ice cream ever,Bought this 3 times now. I love the chunkiness. There subtle salty almost sour of the cheesecake. And the chewiness of the larger chunky pieces. For a non peanut butter fan it is one of the only non chocolate based ice creams I like.
13_bj,2020-07-03,5,My favorite flavor!,"Not sure why this flavor doesn’t have better reviews. I love everything about it. The icecream, the cheesecake pieces, the chocolate cookie swirls... amazing! I will continue to buy it for sure. An overall great icecream in my opinion."
13_bj,2020-06-27,5,"Oh man, those cheesecake chunks are real!",Fat cheesecake chunks that haven’t disintegrated into the tasty caramel cheesecake ice cream. Great distribution of cookie crumbs. Went straight to the top of my favorite flavors. I eat it straight from the pint and don’t share!
13_bj,2019-11-12,4,I will buy again,"Hello, this Ice cream was delicious to me and my boyfriend. However, I barely had any cheesecake pieces and the caramel was SUPER light. The formula should be revamped to include more cheesecake and caramel. Still good Though."
13_bj,2019-06-01,2,Ice cream !,"I wasn’t very impressed about this ice cream ...
the cookie swirls were barely in there , as well as the cheesecake balls. The ice cream itself tasted a little bland.
I don’t think I will be purchasing this flavor again"
13_bj,2019-07-06,1,Awful!,The cheesecake pieces are horrible! Doesnt even taste like cheesecake and slightly sour flavor. Dont even know what they used but it wasnt cheesecake and it wasnt good at all. I love ben & jerrys but this was good awful
13_bj,2020-04-12,4,Not the same,"I was reading the reviews on this, and most of them are for the Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake *Truffle* flavor. This is not the same flavor. It isn't bad, but it isn't as good as it's predecessor. =( I am bummed out."
13_bj,2020-05-07,3,What happened?,This used to be my Friday night guilty pleasure when it was truffles and now I feel like I've wasted $4. Why was this changed? The cheesecake pieces are too big and the flavor is different. I won't be buying it again.
13_bj,2020-03-27,5,Favorite flavor ever,This is my absolute favorite flavor of any brand ice cream. My #1. BUT my local Walmart hasn’t had it the last few shopping trips which is really disappointing. I hope you never stop making this. My world would end.
13_bj,2020-07-20,5,Love the cheesecake pieces,I tried to only eat a little bit and couldn’t help myself. The cheesecake pieces are so delicious with the chocolate and caramel flavor. I love that they are not stingy with the cheesecake pieces. Absolute perfection.
13_bj,2020-08-18,5,Delicious!,"Stopped at the store looking for the cookies and cream cheesecake core, which the store did not have so I decided to give this one a whirl. So glad I did, it was AMAZING! The cookie swirl really drives this one home!"
13_bj,2018-08-08,5,Jam packed so good,Anyone who reported 3 stars or less is seriously deranged. This flavor is so jam packed full of flavor. You have to read the description several times tonappreciate how much goodness is in this. 5 stars easily
13_bj,2019-10-08,3,Just enh,"I was so excited to try this flavor, but sadly it falls short of what I hoped I would find. The cookie swirl is tasty, but the cheesecake truffles are weird globs. I don't really get any graham cracker crust"
13_bj,2019-06-01,4,Almost,Loved the caramel flavor and the cookie swirl. Wish there was more cookie in it. Agree with other reviewers the chunks of cheesecake are not so good. If I take out the cheesecake chunks...so delicious.
13_bj,2018-09-09,5,Love it!,"One of the best flavors-the cheesecake is chewy, but melts into your mouth-the graham cracker is delicious-and caramel, well....caramel is delicious no matter what. This entire combination is a winner."
13_bj,2019-03-30,5,Unbelievably addicting.,I hope they NEVER stop making this. This is all of my favorite flavors in one. Its not too sweet or too rich. I'm able to eat the whole thing and not blink an eye. I have 2 in my freezer hidden away.
13_bj,2019-01-24,5,This is a Kiss From God,The ice cream is so good it's ridiculous and the cookie swirl makes me emotional. The cheesecake truffles are not as good as the cheesecake in the 'Core' pint. This is a must try for all humans!
13_bj,2019-04-19,5,Delicious!!,Love this flavor. The cheesecake bits are less creamy than expected but they are frozen so it makes sense. I love the caramel ice cream and wish there was more of the chocolate cookie!!! So good!
13_bj,2019-11-21,5,Love love love it,"I love this new combo, I just discovered it a few days ago, and today I went back to buy another when I thought, how would this taste if instead of the cheesecake pieces it was a cheesecake core."
13_bj,2018-05-27,5,My new favorite!,Tried this new flavor and I love it! The cheesecake flavor of the ice cream base is delicious and is so creamy! The cookie swirl adds a nice crunchy texture while the truffles are nice and soft!
13_bj,2019-07-26,1,The worst flavor,I love cheesecake and carmel so I thought I’d love this pint of Ben and Jerry’s! The truffles were so terrible I had to throw them out. This flavor needs a lot of work. I wouldn’t buy it again.
13_bj,2018-04-30,5,absolutely rich and comforting,"I was skeptical about this and I am very picky about my cheesecake. This was sooo addicting and I could eat it without feeling heavy after. Definitely my new favorite, sorry ""Tonight Dough""!"
13_bj,2018-05-11,3,It won't let me put the title I want -,"Yeah, I'm sure it's 3 stars i.e and only 1 other person selected 3 stars, so: 2. Maybe a step high in sodium or sugar. Also seems the things of just 4g protein get to us but thank you"
13_bj,2018-07-01,1,So VERY disappointing,Doesn't taste like caramel or cheesecake or truffles. Big globs of greasy yukky stuff. They've run out of good ideas. Gonna throw this out and stick with the old favorites.
13_bj,2019-02-07,5,yummy yummy,"this is now my favorite flavor!! so many layers of flavor and I love all the chunks of truffle covered cheesecake, bits of chocolate and the graham cracker crust yum yum"
13_bj,2020-05-29,1,"Used to be good, then they changed it","I used to eat this ice cream every single day.... they change the cheesecake truffles and now it's awful
Probably good that they did... now I can start my diet! Hahaha"
13_bj,2018-08-15,3,Good ice cream!!,Just tried this ice cream!! The flavors are very good!! The only reason I didn’t give more stars is because I feel like the cheesecake pieces could have more flavor :(
13_bj,2018-06-06,5,The best flavor yet,I brought this flavor yesterday and I’m going get another one day. I love that it doesn’t have the chocolate flakes in it. Everything is amazing about this one.
13_bj,2018-07-24,1,Disappointed,Cheesecake truffles had no flavor. The ice cream itself tasted kind of sugar free/low fat. I love caramel and i love cheesecake but this ice cream was not good.
13_bj,2019-09-26,5,New favorite,This is the best! It has the perfect amount of cheesecake pieces and not an overwhelming amount of chocolate. My boyfriend and I finished it in a night!! Lol
13_bj,2019-04-28,5,So sad that I did not know this flavor exsisted!,I am so happy that I have finally found this flavor! This is wonderful. I can not believe anyone gave this one star. Crunchy and chocolatey and cheesy too.
13_bj,2019-09-03,5,the most perfect ice cream ever,"Hands down, best there ever will be! I shudder thinking about a time when this may no longer be made....please dont make that nightmare a reality"
13_bj,2019-06-07,1,Tasted weird,I usually love the cheesecake ice creams but the cheesecakes chunks has a weird taste. I ended up throwing this one away after a few bites.
13_bj,2018-03-13,5,Excellent,Just bought this the other day and no complaints what so ever. Lots of flavor and soooo many cheesecake truffles in mine. Love love love.
13_bj,2018-07-31,5,Absolutely amazing!,"I have been raving about this flavor to anyone that listens. My go-to favorite strawberry cheesecake, but this is a new favorite! Love!"
13_bj,2018-11-04,5,Didn't just meet expectations. It exceeded them!,This flavor was perfect and probably my new favorite flavor of any ice cream. It's a smooth taste combining all the flavors together.
13_bj,2018-08-15,5,AMAZING,"You have to try, the best ice cream I have had in awhile. I think everything about this combo works. I will be buying again."
13_bj,2019-09-03,5,It makes the top 10 list!,"This one is not in my top 5, but it's definitely in my top 10. I love the cookies and I love the cheesecake! It's a keeper!"
13_bj,2018-11-07,5,The Best Flavor,Please Please don't ever get rid of this Flavor it's absolutely amazing. I won't say how many points I have eaten
13_bj,2018-07-18,5,Love the flavors combined!,"This is by far my new favorite and I didn’t even know it’s been out for a while now, but I’m so glad I found it!"
13_bj,2020-04-12,5,Great flavors,I love this ice cream but for last 6 months can't find it in stores near me. Why is this not available anymore
13_bj,2019-07-16,5,Best combination,This ice cream is really good! All the textures fit really well and I love the cheesecake bites in there.
13_bj,2019-04-25,5,Exceeded My Expectations!!!!,"I purchased a pint last night, and it was one of the best flavor combinations I’ve experienced in years!"
13_bj,2018-03-30,5,So Good!!!,"I just bought this....I almost cried!!!
It was SO GOOD!!! I LOVED the caramel cheesecake icecream."
13_bj,2018-10-24,5,My new favorite ice cream!,I bought this recently when the store ran out of Half Baked and it is my new favorite!!
13_bj,2020-02-13,5,My Favorite Flavor,"I haven't really found a flavor that I would not eat, but this one is truly addicting."
13_bj,2018-09-03,5,All time favorite,"This is my new favorite, it’s a perfect balance and the cheesecake pieces are YUM!"
13_bj,2019-07-17,5,New Favorite,This is my favorite Ben and Jerry's flavor. Ever. And I love the cheesecake bites.
13_bj,2019-09-01,5,So Good!,This is one of the best Ben & Jerry’s iced creams! I hope they keep it for awhile!
13_bj,2020-04-09,5,YUUUUUUMMMMMMMM,NEED MORE IN STOCK. CANT FIND THIS AT WALMART IN WATERVILLE MAINE HALF THE TIME.
13_bj,2018-10-28,5,AMAZING,I bought this over the weekend. It is now my new favorite flavor. So delicious!
13_bj,2018-05-18,5,Love it,the chocolate cookie swirls play so wonderfully off of this flavor. I love it!
13_bj,2019-07-22,5,A winner!,"Great flavor combination! Very complimentary with no overpowering ""core""."
13_bj,2018-03-22,5,My favorite!!!,You hit a homerun with this one! I hope this one stands the test of time!
13_bj,2019-02-18,5,The best,Definitely my favorite out of all the flavors. Ben & jerrys is the best.
13_bj,2020-03-12,5,Delicious,This is the best of the best! I am addicted. I can't live without it.
13_bj,2018-07-17,5,YUMMMMM!!!,Absolutely yum! Please keep making this heavenly delightful flavor!!!
13_bj,2018-06-11,5,Deeeeeeeelicious!,So delicious! My new favorite. It is the perfect marriage of flavors.
13_bj,2018-10-22,5,New Flavor Alert,Definitely my new favorite Ice cream. Please keep this flavor around!
13_bj,2020-02-23,5,My favorite,Soooooo good! And not overly chocolatey like alot of ben and jerrys.
13_bj,2018-04-22,5,My New Favorite!,This flavor is the best thing ever!! Please never stop selling it!!
13_bj,2020-02-16,5,Super awesome ice cream,I got this like 3x a week love this ice cream thanks ben&Jerry's
13_bj,2018-11-10,5,Cheesecake Lovers Beware,Hands down... best flavor ever!!! Will purchase again and again!
13_bj,2019-05-01,5,Amazing,Love it the cheese cake is yummy and love the chocolate swirls
13_bj,2018-03-16,5,amazing flavor!,"love all the chunks and pieces, would definitely buy again :)"
13_bj,2018-09-16,5,Best Flavor Ever!,They really hit the nail on the head with this one! So good!
13_bj,2020-06-20,5,We have a Winner!,Great tasting cheesecake with a hint of chocolate & Carmel!
13_bj,2019-06-18,5,Actually amazing,Has the perfect amount of everything! I love love love!
13_bj,2018-07-03,5,Simply the best,My new favorite of all time. The truffles are amazing!
13_bj,2018-08-29,5,Best Cheesecake flavor by a mile,If this flavor didnt exist I would quit ice cream!
14_bj,2019-04-23,1,No cherries,My husband brought a pint for me last week. I always loved the cherries. At least as st 6 were in a pint. THIS PINT HAD ONLY 2. Very disappionted.
14_bj,2018-10-29,5,THE BEST ICE CREAM FLAVOR OF. ALL. TIME.,"Wow. Just wow. I mean there's nothing better than this flavor. No topping it. Cherry ice cream combined with cherries and chunks of chocolate? Come on. This is the best flavor of all time. I'm not saying there aren't other delicious flavors that fill me with intense, creamy, passionate emotion, but cherry garcia is home. Cherry garcia is the dog that you cuddle up with on the couch after a long day of dragging your feet through the world. Cherry garcia is the mother that rubs your sweet lil head after the local school bully called your shoes ""dorky."" Cherry garcia is life. Such a wonderful flavor. I'm a life-long fan and I will pass this flavor on to my kids, my kids' kids, and their kids' kids. I love it."
14_bj,2020-04-15,1,Very Disappointed!!!!!,"We bought 2 pints of Cherry Garcia yesterday at our local Frys Store in San Tan Valley, AZ. This has been my favorite flavor for more than 23 years. Unfortunately my husband and I are very disappointed. This ice cream does not taste like anything at all. The first thing we noticed was that it had no color at all, it was like eating plain cream. The only taste was the occasional piece of chocolate and a piece of cherry. I only had a quarter of the pint, the rest will go in the garbage. So Sad."
14_bj,2017-10-29,5,"Try it, you’ll like it!","I’ve held off on this flavor for years. It seemed simple and less than exciting. Ben and Jerry’s is my secret soul food, so when I do it, I pick overtly decadent and rich like Phish Food. I got stuck with this when the hubby picked for me and he loves “cherry” anything. So, needless to say, I was so not happy inside to see Cherry Garcia. I even left it in time out in the freezer a whole day! I pulled it out the next day, fully expecting disappointment. Took a bite or two, and couldn’t stop! This is now my favorite ice cream of all time!! There’s a special sweet balance between the chunks of frozen cherries and giant chunks of frozen chocolate all generously dispersed in mellow vanilla. Every single bite was heaven! But don’t tell my husband! Gotta keep him on his toes!"
14_bj,2018-10-17,5,My all time favorite ice cream and flavor!,"This is my all time favorite ice cream and flavor. For many years we lived in an area that had roadside ice cream stands with homemade icecream. They were absolutely delicious and I enjoyed supporting a local shop, but even having had those flavors I still would choose Cherry Garcia over them all. It's kind of like an old friend, good for the soul.
Oh, and the new chocolate cherry Garcia is yummy too!"
14_bj,2017-08-30,5,"I don't like cherry, but I love Cherry Garcia.","A co-worker bought me a pint of this a few years back. She didn't know I dislike cherry. I hate cherry soda, cherry pie, cherry ice cream, etc. But I tried it anyway, and fell in love. It's the only cherry-flavored thing I like."
14_bj,2017-10-03,5,This is the best thing that could possibly exist.,"This product is amazing, it is the greatest ice cream flavor to touch my tongue. Anyone that thinks otherwise is wrong. Cherry Garcia is the epitome of ice cream, and that is a fact."
14_bj,2017-12-10,5,The Best Ice Cream!,"Two years ago, this was the first Ben and Jerry's ice cream I ever had. Since then I have tried many different flavors, but this one is still my favorite by far. I get a pint of Cherry Garcia at least once a week!"
14_bj,2020-01-29,5,I love this one!,"This was the first Ben and Jerry flavor I had outside a scoop shop, in a pint at home. It’s got great cherry flavor in the ice cream itself and the cherry chunks themselves are great tasting and very plentiful. The fudge seals the deal and makes this a regular in my freezer!"
14_bj,2018-05-13,5,"Just one teeny, tiny complaint...","I've eaten this flavor for a decade or more. It's definitely my go to, but, if I could change anything about it I would change ratio of cherries to chocolate in favor of cherries by at least 8:1. If not more. Honestly I'd say leave the chocolate out period but I know there'd be war. I just can't get enough of the cherries. And sometimes I get a pint that's almost all fudge chips & no cherries. Frustrating. But it's still the best current flavor."
14_bj,2018-05-03,5,What about THAT cherries!,"First, I'm not the greater fan of cherries, and I'm really bought this pint only for trying something new."
14_bj,2019-11-01,2,Only cherries with this garcia,I’m so bummed. I love Ben and Jerry’s but this pint of Cherry Garcia- is all cherry. I literally scooped the whole pint into a bowl to make sure. I only had 1 small chocolate slice. Not happy
14_bj,2018-08-21,2,i guess i’m the only one who doesn’t like this.,maybe i had a bad batch. but the “cherry ice cream” had no cherry flavor at all. it tasted like pure milk with just chunks of cherry throughout. and then bits of fudge flakes. they just tasted like pieces off a dark chocolate bar. i guess this flavor is just not for me
14_bj,2017-07-08,1,Disappointing,"Since the takeover of B&J, it has become increasingly difficult to find my favorite Cherry Garcia. So, very happy to find two 500ml containers at Sobeys. $5.49 each. I have opened and eaten the entire first container. NO CHERRY - NONE - NOT A SINGLE BIT OF CHERRY! And it ""ain't"" pink ice cream any more - whitish/yellowish bland tasting stuff. Why would you want to screw up the best ice cream ever?? I hope you made a good profit on these two containers because I will not be buying any in the future! SAD!"
14_bj,2020-04-06,5,My favorite ice cream,"IBe tried multiple flavors of Ben n jerry ice cream but nothing compares to this flavor. It’s so perfect with the right ratio of the creamy vanilla ice cream, chunks of dark chocolate (which I know might make u standoffish but trust me it goes amazing together) and the amazing juicy cherries. Every time I go to my local store I grab a pint because it’s just so delicious you always need to have it near by!"
14_bj,2018-07-06,5,,"It's not difficult to see why Ben & Jerry's has used this flavor in so many different products, because it is a good, safe flavor and for that reason, it gets a BUY IT rating. If you want a comforting ice cream treat and don't want to have your brain confused by having flavors coming at you from every different direction, this is a great choice for you and you will not regret it."
14_bj,2019-03-05,5,,Such an amazing ice cream unlike any other. The cherries in this are surprisingly fresh. I'm not usually a fan of ice cream with fruit because the fruit is usually very soft and mushy but the cherries in this are firm and fresh. The ice cream itself is very creamy and the chocolate is the perfect amount of cocoa without being too dark.
14_bj,2019-01-03,4,,"I really like this ice cream, but I prefer the Cherry Garcia formula in the frozen yogurt option. The frozen yogurt is not on Influenster, so I couldn’t review it. This ice cream is very creamy and rich. The cherries are flavourful and juicy. This flavour of ice cream is so unique. I highly recommend this flavour and brand."
14_bj,2018-09-13,4,One Of Our All Time Favorites!,"We have been purchasing Ben &Jerry's Ice Cream for decades. Have tried many varieties, and have a few we buy regularly, but Cherry Garcia is my husband and son's all time favorite!! We purchase an average of one per week of this flavor. Over the years it's always been pretty consistant in taste and formulation, however the last few pints we purchased had much less chocolate chunks. One pint seemed to have a few chunks only on the bottom of the pint. My husband said ""WHERE ARE THE CHOCOLATE CHUNKS'??"" Happened to the chocolate""??? We think it must have been a fluke in manufactuing and we caught a bad batch as we purchased both pints in the same store. We had this problem with the lack of chocolate chunks in their Cherry Garcia slices, but untll now, never the pints. In ""fairness"" I am giving this product a high rating because this issue with the lack of chocolate chunks has only been with the last 2 pints we purchased, and overall it's a good product..."
14_bj,2019-02-04,5,,SO I love the Dead and I'm from the bay area & I have so many fond memories on Haight stopping at B & J's for ice cream. I usually get one scoop of CG and one scoop of Phish Food and it really feeds my body and soul. I never am without a lil personal pint of CG in my house. Its the best ice cream in the world :)
14_bj,2018-06-06,4,,"These days, I can’t snuggle up on the couch with a container of Ben and Jerry’s and eat as much as I want- but I can have a scoop every once in a while, so I do - and Cherry Garcia is my guilty pleasure ice cream of choice. Just don’t let it thaw too much before re freezing, or it gets all crystallized."
14_bj,2019-03-08,5,,"This is one of my favorite flavors of Ben & Jerrys ice cream! The cherry ice cream doesnt taste too artificial and is delicious, I only wish they sold this in a half gallon versus just a pint! I will buy this over and over again without a doubt!"
14_bj,2017-07-04,4,Love it but I vote for vanilla ice cream.,"As a kid, my two favorite hand-dipped ice creams were cherry vanilla and chocolate chunk. Imagine my delight when you brought out Cherry Garcia and with a great name. But then...the cherry flavored ice cream. Still good, still recommend, not as great. Please...bring back the vanilla!"
14_bj,2018-09-04,2,Not For Me,"Too much of a maraschino cherry flavor for my taste. I would prefer more of a fresh cherry taste. That being said, I can see how others would like it assuming an appreciation for maraschino cherries."
14_bj,2017-06-04,5,Change back to vanilla ice cream in Cherry Garcia,"I prefer the vanilla because of the texture. The cherry ice cream is a little ""gummier"". The new Chocolate Cherry Garcia is interesting but the chocolate tends to cover up a lot of the cherry flavor. It's all still better than anything else around!"
14_bj,2019-05-21,2,Sadly disappointed..,"I bought this last week from Publix because I normally love this ice cream. For some reason though, it was very gritty and didn't taste anywhere near as good as normal... :("
14_bj,2020-03-19,5,BRUH,"TO DIE FOR oh my god I love this ice cream I buy it for my boyfriend all the time and i’m how he found it and also my best friend , I introduced it to her too I love this ice cream :^"
14_bj,2017-09-10,5,Best flavor around.,"Always on my shopping list. Favorite flavor of any brand. large cherries and big chunks of chocolate always make me smile. perfect after breakfast, lunch or dinner snack."
14_bj,2020-02-23,5,My go to,"My all time favorite, I love the chocolate chunks with the cherry! It’s too hard for me to try new flavors because my eyes always go back to this flavor!!"
14_bj,2020-03-19,4,Amazing!,"I first tried this not very long ago (almost a week ago), and I was very pleased. Love the singing cow on the pint :)."
14_bj,2018-06-03,5,,Cherry garcia is my absolute favorite ben and jerry's flavor. The chunks of chocolate and cherry.... mmm so delicious.
14_bj,2018-03-23,2,What happened to the fudge swirls!!!??,"This used to be my all time favorite ice, like out of this world incredible. However, I distinctly remember it used to have BIG FUDGE SWIRLS and not lame chocolate flakes. I raved about this ice cream to all my friends only to be soooo dissappointed to find they changed the recipe to flakes! My friends were not impressed to say the least even though the flavor is the same it was such a downer!! Bring back the THICK FUDGE SWIRLS !!!!!!!!!’"
14_bj,2020-02-08,5,Childhood Favorite,I cannot get enough of Cherry Garcia. Been my go-to since I was a kid.
14_bj,2018-01-14,5,best if you add banana with it,it is so good and you should buy it because it tastes so good
14_bj,2017-08-29,5,My Fave,Cherry Garcia is my go to when I'm feeling down and out.
14_bj,2017-09-10,5,C.G. since I can remember!,Long before I discovered the GD I was eating CG! <3
14_bj,2019-02-05,3,Confused,"Ordinarily, I would give Cherry Garcia 5+ stars. However, on two occasions (10+ years ago in San Francisco and today in Lewes, DE), the beautiful dark burgundy bing cherries were replaced with supersweet, bright red maraschino cherries that I usually only tolerate as singles atop my sundae whipped cream. What's going on?? I realize the ingredients label just lists “cherries,” but I'm hoping these two occasions were anomalies."
14_bj,2017-07-26,5,The best cherry ice cream,"I decided to try the ice cream because I love anything cherry flavored and it surprised me, it's nothing like the other ones I've tried. Everybody should have this ice cream, it's fenomenal"
14_bj,2019-10-12,1,HATE Maraschino Cherries!,"Bought this tonight, cheap at BJ's, two three packs. Figured if Ben & Jerry's, got to be good, and I LOVE Cherries. and they can't mess up Cherry Ice Cream...LOL!
Well, I love the fatty smooth mouth feel, creamy... but the cherries... aggg! No, No, NOT Maraschino Cherries!!
As a side note, the chocolate would be better if it melted in the mouth easier."
14_bj,2018-11-09,5,,I love Ben and Jerry’s Cherry Garcia ice cream. I have had the ice cream bar and the ice cream in the bucket. It taste nice and fresh. It’s so good. It’s one of my favorite ice creams to buy. If I am at a convenient store I looks for the ice cream bar. It’s very fulfilling too. I would recommend this ice cream to anyone.
14_bj,2018-11-08,5,,This is my favorite ice cream of all time. There’s nothing else like it! I love the little cherry pieces with vanilla ice cream and chocolate bars. It’s a treat on any day for me. And I wouldn’t pick any other kind over cherry Garcia. If you haven’t tried it yet you absolutely have to!
14_bj,2018-08-24,5,I’ll never stop eating this,My husband and I were in bed and all of a sudden a craving for my favorite Ben and Jerry’s. He took me to our local Walmart and bought me a pint of it. On the way home I had him go through McDonald’s to get a spoon so I could eat my ice cream on the way home because I couldn’t wait!!!
14_bj,2019-03-25,1,Why the Change?!?!,What was once my favorite ice cream no longer holds that place in my heart. I loved the freshness and contrast of the vanilla ice cream with the big chunks of cherries. And the chocolate used to be real chocolate with that lovely chocolate snap. Now it’s fudge and cloying. No snap.
14_bj,2019-02-09,5,Delicious!!,"My first two containers were gritty and the second one was crystalized, but would become creamy as the crystals melted. I loved both of them...lol, but I can't wait to get my hands on a creamy batch that hasn't melted and refrozen. I can just imagine how good that one's gonna be!!"
14_bj,2018-06-05,5,,"Oh Lord, this ice cream is the best! It is quite the indulgence due to the high fat content and I try to purchase the lower fat version, if available. This flavor is a bit difficult to find in my area but it is delicious and does have a high price point. Definitely recommend."
14_bj,2018-08-29,5,LOVE AT FIRST BITE,"I buy this ice cream pint every time i go to walmart! Its so good, especially because of the size of the chocolate flakes and cherries. I swear, every bite you take has either a cherry or chocolate piece. Not too sweet or too sweet but perfect and I don't even like cherries."
14_bj,2017-08-16,5,NOT worthy!,This is a dang good ice cream!
14_bj,2019-01-03,5,,"This flavor should not work but it does. I’d seen people rave about Cherry Garcia but, as someone who does not like artificial cherry anything, I was super uninterested... but it’s so good! The cherries are delicious and the chocolate balances it out so nicely."
14_bj,2019-08-24,5,The GOAT of ice cream flavors!,"It's probably been 20 years since I first had Cherry Garcia, and I swear nothing has ever been more delicious. Now, I certainly LIKE other flavors but this one is by far the best. Not overwhelmingly sweet, just enough crunch and the cherry pieces are amazing."
14_bj,2018-10-01,5,,One word YUM. This ice cream has real chunks of cherry in it. The mix of chocolate and cherry is phenomenal. I find this ice cream to be delicious. It was the first Ben & Jerry's I ever tried. It's expensive but it's so worth the price! Get a spoon and try!!
14_bj,2018-09-07,5,,MY FAVORITE ICECREAM OMG I wish I had some right now! There's sooooooo many cherries in this ice cream not like other icecream that doesn't give you any cherries just chocolate I hate that lol. This is my favorite icecream forever and always it's the best
14_bj,2018-11-08,5,,"Ben and Jerry's produce quality ice cream and this is a favorite flavor of mine. I've always liked chocolate covered cherries and this is a frozen version! B&J's ice cream is more expensive than other brands, so I tend to purchase it when it is on sale."
14_bj,2020-05-19,5,YUMMY!,this is my absolute favorite flavor! im not much of a chocolate person so im always very happy when we have a pint of this. although i mus say lately i havent been getting as many cherries as i would like. but i still love the flavor and keep it up!
14_bj,2019-02-02,5,,This is THE ice cream for when you have a fight with your best friend or boyfriend. Delicious and totally worth the calories. It's banana with chocolate and it tastes like heaven. This ice cream along with a feel good 90's movie is the bomb dot com.
14_bj,2018-12-04,5,,"I was so not excited when my husband picked out this ice cream flavor for me. I mean cherry ice cream? How can that be good? Well, it is! It's one of my favorites. The cherry is so soft and subtle and balances so nicely with the chocolate. Amazing."
14_bj,2018-08-05,5,,This is my guilty pleasure. I could eat this ice cream all day. I love the flavor of the cherry with the chocolate. I get it out of the freezer and let it sit for 5-10 minutes then eat it because it softens so perfectly it just melts in your mouth.
14_bj,2018-01-30,5,Best tasting ice cream in the entire world,"If you don't like Cherry Garcia ice cream, then you'll never be happy with any other ice cream. I've tried hundreds of flavors (including all Ben & Jerry's) and dozens of brands, nothing comes close. I can't help having a serving every day."
14_bj,2018-07-02,5,,"This is a Ben and Jerry’s classic flavor and it is so tasty! The ice cream is smooth, creamy and sweet and there are huge chunks of real cherry. There are big chunks of dark chocolate that is a perfect finishing touch. This is a yummy treat."
14_bj,2019-06-11,3,Did the recipe change?,"My son, who has some allergies to raw cherries and apples, could always eat this ice cream. For some reason his recent purchase set off his allergies a good bit. The ice cream is great if you don't have allergies, but take care if you do."
14_bj,2018-12-05,5,,"Cherry Garcia is one of my absolute favorite flavors. Like, top 5 flavors of all time. The cherry ice cream with the addition of natural cherry halves is so refreshing and the chocolate chunks are a welcome addition to the flavor profile."
14_bj,2018-07-03,5,,This is the only flavor I’ve tried from Ben and Jerry’s and I love it. It has a great flavor! I love the cherry and chocolate flakes in it! I get it at Walmart for a reasonable price. My favorite flavor of ice cream. 10/10 recommend.
14_bj,2020-05-23,5,Best Ever!,I’m an ice cream fanatic! Obsessed completely. I ate my way through gelato shops in Italy and still Cherry Garcia is my favorite flavor. The unique cherry ice cream is creamy and paired well with chunks of chocolate and cherries.
14_bj,2019-02-04,5,,Cherry Garcia is one of the best ice creams I have ever had. I live the Ben and Jerrys brand and wish tat my local store had more flavors to try. We used to have a local ice cream parlor and when it closed I was sad to see it go.
14_bj,2019-06-25,1,Cherry Garcia bars has no cherries,"I purchased a box of nine bars at BJ’s of the Cherry Garcia and only 3 bars had chocolate chips, cherries, and cherry ice cream. The other 6 bars contained only chocolate chips and vanilla ice cream. I don’t know what happened."
14_bj,2018-10-11,5,,One of my all time favorite ice creams. Has such a nice flavor and it seems like you get a little of everything with every bite. I just wish this ice cream came in bigger containers because these small ones don't last long
14_bj,2018-08-01,5,,Cherries are my favourite fruit and so I've tried a lot of cherry ice creams. A lot of them fall flat. But the flavour of this combined with the consistency and size of fruit chunks is very well put together. I love this
14_bj,2020-05-11,1,Cherry Garcia,"What happen to this Ice Cream. Within the last few months this product has deteriorated few Cherry’s , little chocolate, is just plain ice cream . If I wanted plain Jane ice cream I can find that anywhere. Disappointed"
14_bj,2018-11-03,4,Almost perfect,"The fruit and chocolate combination is what makes this flavor a winner. The chocolate chunks are very large, and I would rather have a chocolate chip versus a chunk. More cherry, less chocolate chunk would be perfect."
14_bj,2018-06-02,5,,My favorite ice cream is chocolate chip and cherry and this combines the two perfectly! I would eat these every day if I could without any consequences haha. I would recommend not only this flavor but this whole brand
14_bj,2018-06-17,2,almond flavor Cherry Garcia,i bought this not realizing it was made with Almond milk. i will never buy this again.
14_bj,2018-03-24,2,Cocoa processed with Alkali,This is not a healthy Cocoa. Please remove the processing of cocoa from your ice creams. Just use cocoa.
14_bj,2018-07-07,5,,As a kid I wasn't a fan of Cherry Garcia. But now as an adult-ish it's one of the best has complex flavored in the base and the cherries are always really good. I think Ben and Jerry's is pretty affordable.
14_bj,2018-12-05,5,,Omg this is the only brand of ice cream I buy! The cherries are cut in half and taste so good ! And I love that the chocolate chunks are big . Literally every spoonful has a piece of cherry or chocolate
14_bj,2018-08-01,5,,"I love Ben & Jerry's, they are so creative with their flavors they cone up with and I've never had one i didn't like. I also love everything this company stands for, they are good people."
14_bj,2018-11-13,5,,This is my go to flavor for Ben and Jerry’s. It’s so tasty and creamy and I just love it! It’s such a good combo with the pieces of cherry and chocolate and I overall enjoy this flavor!
14_bj,2019-03-05,5,,"When I am craving ice cream, I literally always go for Ben and Jerrys either the cherry garcia or strawberry cheesecake. I like how creamy they are and less sugary than other brands."
14_bj,2018-09-13,5,,BEST flavor of all time. Just the right balance between the cherry taste and the chocolate taste. Even my friends that don't like the taste of cherry's really enjoy this ice cream
14_bj,2019-06-22,5,ultimate fav,"literally eaten sooo many of these. it brings me back so many memories with my friends, eating cherry garcia and watching movies. always recommend it. I hope it stays forever."
14_bj,2019-08-24,1,I strongly dislike the cherries,"I don't know what kind of cherries these are, but I could not eat them. I love sour cherries, but these were terrible. I ate the ice cream, but I did not eat the cherries."
14_bj,2019-07-14,5,Smooth,"I was raised on bluebell, and when I tell you I gave it up so quick when I tasted this ice cream. It’s creamy, and the over all quality of the ingredients are far superior!"
14_bj,2018-09-02,5,Love since day 1,"This is mine and my moms favorite flavor, in fact she almost named me after it, thanks to my gma I am NOT named after ice cream no matter how delicious it may be"
14_bj,2018-10-23,5,,This is so bomb. So chocolatey and cherry at the same time. Very creamy and high quality. Go to but very sweet and High calorie. It’s a rare but delicious treat
14_bj,2018-08-03,5,,"What is life without Cherry Garcia? For a long time, I knew this life, but once I had it, that life was a long distant memory. I wish to never see it again."
14_bj,2018-11-08,5,,Well I don’t really like cherries but I decided to take this one home a try it... and wowww amazing I love Ben a Jerry’s ice creams and this one is a YES
14_bj,2019-01-06,5,,"Even the Ben & Jerry’s can be a little expensive, it will always be worth the price because it’s always delicious and they use great ingredients inside."
14_bj,2018-12-02,2,,I love Ben&Jerry’s but I didn’t like this flavor it’s just too sweet. They had a cotton candy flavor I loved but they discontinued it I’m disappointed.
14_bj,2018-08-03,5,,I love Ben & Jerry's. I love that they use new fresh ingredients and the fact that there really isn't that artificial flavor taste in the ice cream
14_bj,2020-02-09,1,Disappointed,I love this flavour so much but I bought one last week from adonis griffintown and I was very disappointed that it only had one cherry in it!!
14_bj,2018-06-07,5,,This is my all time favorite Ben and Jerry’s ice cream! The Cherries and the chocolate chunks are so delicious it’s well worth the money!
14_bj,2019-03-09,5,,Good balance of fruity and chocolatey flavors. Im always a big fam of ben and jerrys but the Cherry Garcia is especially good. So chunky!
14_bj,2017-12-23,5,Best ice cream ever,By this flavor all the time. For about 3 months this is all I ate with added merichino cherries and it's juice I lost 35lb no kidding.
14_bj,2019-06-01,5,First time experience,First time experience With this flavor and the pint slice presentation. Both the flavor and the pint slice get a thumbs up from me.
14_bj,2019-12-17,5,Cherri garcia,I normally like chocolate and vanilla but the cherry garcia is excellent. Love it with all the cherries and chocolate. Very good.

14_bj,2020-01-01,5,Delicious,I have enjoyed this ice cream so much. Thank you for making it. Jerry Garcia Band compliments this ice cream quite well.
14_bj,2019-03-03,4,,Ben and Jerry's ice cream is delicious very affordable great tasting and the prices for the ice cream is very affordable
14_bj,2018-06-11,5,The best ice cream ever,"This will make cherry and chocolate lovers so happy, since I discovered Ben and Jerry's don't need Cold Stone any more."
14_bj,2018-08-25,1,,"I am a been & Jerry's brand,Cherry Garcia is my favorite ice cream I buy this all the time it's the only flavor I buy ."
14_bj,2019-02-02,5,,So good rich and creamy. Worth the price. Love all the flavors so far. Lots of chunks of goodness inside each jar.
14_bj,2018-09-11,5,,"This icecream is classic cherry and vanilla with chocolate pieces in it, its classic but extremely good and creamy"
14_bj,2019-03-08,5,,"I never even considered trying cherry ice cream before this flavor came into my life, and now Ill never turn back."
14_bj,2019-04-07,5,Cherry LOVERS Unite!,This was a flavor that I went to if I really wanted a sweet but not to sweet cherry ice cream any time of the day.
14_bj,2019-02-04,4,,I love this ice cream & I definitely recommend the only thing is that some may find the price to be a little high
14_bj,2019-02-04,5,,I love cherries but not usually in ice cream. This is amazing and I was so surprised to love it as much as I do!

14_bj,2018-06-10,5,I love it,"I ate this and then I wanted more

14_bj,2017-10-11,5,Love it!,I just tried it a few weeks ago and it totally blew my mind.
14_bj,2017-05-20,5,I really like the over all flavor it is not too mu,I got this for my birthday but I've had it many time so good
14_bj,2018-05-16,5,Love it!,Its so good! The best flavour ever! Its a perfect balance.
14_bj,2018-09-06,5,yummy!,One of my favorite flavors. Really yummy. Would eat again.
14_bj,2018-05-13,4,"Cherries, yumm","I love the combination of cherries and chocolate, so good."
14_bj,2018-12-14,5,Best Flavor..with cruncy chunks!,My FAV!! From the very first spoonful...I was hooked!
14_bj,2020-06-16,5,My all time favorite,The first time I tasted this I became an instant fan.
14_bj,2020-06-11,5,The BEST!!,The only ice cream flavor that actually ever mattered
14_bj,2018-08-02,1,Terrible new ingredients,I used to love Cherry Garcia but now its disgusting.
14_bj,2017-11-10,5,good,i bought this a day a ago and i'm so happy i did...
15_bj,2019-08-11,5,Thank you Ben & Jerry's,I was having a really horrible day. Had received some depressing news about a medical procedure I had to have. In a fit of anger and depression I bought this as a comfort food since my usual choices of Karamel Sutra and Urban Bourbon weren't available. And wow. It seriously was so good that it took the edge off the anger and actually made me forget about my stupid health insurance issues for a good 45 minutes. It made those happy brain chemicals kick into gear better than sitting in a room full of puppies. Thank you for making an otherwise crummy day just a little bit better <3
15_bj,2019-02-19,5,For the true coffee lovers,"Ben and Jerry, “Chillin the roast Truffles,” THATS WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT! You have been able to make a coffee flavor icecream with actual coffee flavor, and the coffee liqour truffles? are you kidding me?! Deliscious. This flavor ice cream has just bumped into my #2 containered ice cream and i don’t make these decisions lightly. Well done ben and jerry, well done. its not just about the stuff you put in the icecream, the base flavor makes it, and you hit it out of the park with chillin the roast."
15_bj,2020-07-14,5,FANTASTIC AUTHENTIC COFFEE FLAVOR,"I recently bought this a week ago and have already bought 3. I was most surprised at the authenticity of the coffee flavor. The smooth and [satisfyingly] rich chocolate swirls were a perfect combination when mixed with the ice cream. The chocolate covered truffles were just an added bonus to the already delicious product. My 22 y/o girlfriend who does not enjoy drinking coffee itself ""too much"", also loves this ice cream flavor. 1000/10 (not a typo) would recommend to any coffee lover and non-coffee lover alike."
15_bj,2019-09-28,1,The truffles are horrid in this flavor,"I was super excited to try this new flavor, I've been a big Ben & Jerry's fan for over 25 years. The cold brew coffee ice cream is actually quite tasty and the chocolate fudge swirl is fantastic. But the truffles are absolutely horrific and I'm picking them out as I eat through my pint. They taste like this very bad chemically bourbon flavored ball of nastiness. I don't even know how to describe it they certainly don't have any coffee flavor to them at all it really does taste like a fake chemically flavored alcohol additive. Disappointed and a complete waste of money."
15_bj,2018-07-31,5,BEST COFFEE ICE CREAM EVER!,"I almost did not buy this flavor in my weekly shopping selection because it had “coffee” in the flavor. Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE coffee. But all the “coffee” flavor ice creams I’ve ever had are an injustice to coffee. They’re not well balanced in the flavor, it’s all the same across the brands. BUT THEN I tried this ice cream with coffee flavor and the liquor, coffee etc, whatever all is in this makes it absolutely delicious. My store is out of it - I’ve checked 3 stores! I hope it’s not gone forever!!! LOVE THIS FLAVOR!"
15_bj,2018-05-28,3,"Was good, but not great","There were things I liked and some I didn't. Firstly, I really did enjoy the cold brew coffee ice cream. It wasn't very sweet and was strong of coffee flavor, which I liked. If you're a fan of sugary coffee, this probably won't be for you. The fudge swirls tasted good as well, but there wasn't enough in my opinion."
15_bj,2020-02-12,2,Not Impressed,"This had the usual new label on it so of course I needed to buy it. I opened and tasted it and well it has very nice flavors, however the flavors are rather lingering. I am also one that enjoys ""stuff"" in the ice cream and this was rather lacking. The swirl was ok, rather thick and sticky also has that liquor flavoring however the wafers were lacking and rather thin for the thickness of the swirl. The ice cream is Ben and Jerry's it's always good, however this flavor wasn't to my liking the flavor had kin of a grit to it. Other than that it was ice cream and I do love Ice cream!! I'd suggest a friend try it to compare it to my views...other than that not so much!"
15_bj,2018-06-12,2,"Had high hopes, did not deliver","When my two favorite flavors, Oat of this Swirled and One Sweet World, sadly disappeared from my store, I turned to this flavor. I like Coffee Coffee, Buzz, Buzz, Buzz, but I wanted to try something new from the truffles line. Despite opening this up to a giant air bubble (picture attached), I hoped for a successful flavor. I'm not sure if I can email customer service about this air bubble as I had recently already found one- which would make it look sketchy if I emailed. However, I was very disappointed. The cold brew ice cream is bitter and has a weird aftertaste, and the truffles had a somewhat chalky texture. I would not recommend this flavor, but if you are against wasting ice cream and do not want to throw it out, try eating it with some sort of chocolate or chocolate based ice cream."
15_bj,2018-08-26,1,No thank you,"I hoped this would be a replacement for my former favorite, the original coffee heath bar. NOPE! The ice cream flavor is horrible. Advertised as cold brewed. Tastes more like a pot of Dunkin that has sat on the burner all day. The rum is unpleasant and I can't even describe the ""truffles"". I probably would have been more satisfied with something generic and unoriginal. If you insist on trying to be trendy and adding booze to your ice cream, why not start with something safe and unimaginative like an Irish coffee with a local whiskey and maybe a caramel swirl."
15_bj,2018-04-20,1,"Sorry Guys, but it is awful.","I was very excited to see new flavors yesterday while I strolled down my favorite aisle at the supermarket. Besides my usual go to's, I grabbed a pint of ""Chillin' the Roast."""
15_bj,2018-06-23,1,My disappointment is immeasurable/my day is ruined,"I was craving Ben and Jerry's tonight so made the journey to my closest convenience store to grab a pint. I usually opt for the trusty Tonight Dough, but was delighted to see some new flavors. This one in particular, ""Chillin' the Roast Truffles,"" immediately grabbed my attention. I'm a coffee lover/addict, and I do enjoy a good chocolate truffle. I figured this flavor would be right up my alley. BUT... I was wrong. The coffee ice cream is actually pretty good. But the truffles taste AWFUL. Instead of ""chocolate liqueur,"" the truffles taste like balls filled with a butterscotch that has been soaked in Kahlua for too long (and not in a good way). I love alcohol but these truffles are DISGUSTING. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined."
15_bj,2018-10-21,1,Duuuuude. Never been so disappointed,"Ugh, my heart hurts to even write this but this is by far the worst ice cream I’ve ever had from you guys!!! The fact that I can’t get my $5 makes it worse. I’ve tried a plethora of others flavors and was never disappointed but this is so.darn.disgusting. Take it back Benny, take it back"
15_bj,2018-04-29,2,"I expected at least an 8, I got a 4 at best","I really love coffee, particularly cold brew. When I saw this product, I ventured away from my typical ice cream choice of Tonight Dough, and I was downright ecstatic to try it out. Did I think that it would measure up to Tonight Dough or S'more? No. But, I did expect more than what I got. It just did not live up to the quality one would expect from a Ben and Jerry's ice cream. I would not recommend. It tastes like a weird type of coffee ice cream. The truffles are too sweet, and the 'fudge' ribbons in the product do not taste like fudge to me. They are very rich. I am sure some people might enjoy it, I however was disappointed. I came in expecting at least an 8, and left with half a pint of ice cream and a strong 4."
15_bj,2018-03-22,3,Not bad but not great,The ice cream itself is really good. Strongest coffee tasting ice cream I've had from Ben and jerry's. The truffle part is disgusting though and there isn't much of a fudge swirl. What I mean by much is nun at all basically.
15_bj,2020-06-05,5,That good good,"This is my favorite ice cream. When 711 carried it by my house I was livin’ on easy street but now I live in an ocean of chaos. There seems to be little to no hope in finding it again. But I will carry on. I will not cease to search out the good good. That’s actually why I’m on this site. I couldn’t believe it has a 3 star rating. My mama always said if you don’t have anything nice to say don’t say anything at all. It’s delicious. Strong robust flavour. Creamy good goodness and all the little tasties that they add to the mix, ya dig? Try it for yourself and let’s keep this one on the shelves."
15_bj,2018-04-02,5,Delicious,"Absolutely delicious l, intense coffee flavor with a nice undertone of the liquor."
15_bj,2018-06-27,2,It made my mouth sad,"I bought this ice cream flavor, because I am a coffee flavor addict. I mean I even eat chocolate covered expresso beans. My favorite Coffee, Coffee, Buzz, Buzz, Buzz flavor has apparently been discontinued in my neck of the woods. The only place I can actually find it is at the little Ben & Jerry's stand in our local mall. The flavor of the ice cream itself is great. I even enjoyed the swirls of fudge. The coffee liqueur was disgusting. It tarnished the whole pint of ice cream for me. I was strong and bitter, just not a pleasant taste. I tried to eat around it, but I ended up throwing the container out. Back to purchasing hand packed pints of my favorite from the local mall. Hopefully they will never stop ordering it."
15_bj,2019-03-31,1,Overall disappointed,"I have 2 go to flavors when picking B&J, but craved coffee ice cream and decided to branch out. The cold brew sounded amazing, the cookie crumble is my favorite part about The Tonight Dough, and the liquor truffle sounded great considering the complemented flavors. The cold brew ice cream was left a little lacking in my opinion but was edible. The fudge and cookie crumble was really good, but I could not get over the truffle itself. It tasted too strong and overpowered everything else, which I wouldn’t mind, if it had tasted good. It was too strong, and too fake of a liquor taste. I love you B&J, your Tonight Dough and Phish Food are amazing, but the truffle just didn’t cut it for me, and the ice cream itself was lacking."
15_bj,2018-07-05,3,Not bad...,"Not bad, but the other Ben and Jerry’s coffee flavors are better, in my opinion. The ice cream was very good but the truffles were too strong for my taste, and a little strange. The chocolate swirl was also a little too intense. You can definitely taste that it’s cold brew as opposed to regular coffee and it’s impressive that B&J was able to capture that difference. No amateur ice cream makers, this group."
15_bj,2018-03-19,1,It is not good,"I love Ben & Jerry's. I especially love the mocha and coffee flavored ice creams, so I was very excited to try Chillin' the Roast. I am sorry to report it is by far the worst B&J flavor that I've ever tried. The cold brew flavored ice cream was fine, it was not offensive and with the right add-ins it could have been a decent flavor. However, the truffles were terrible; they tasted sour and occasionally a little like blue cheese. I'm sad this was so bad, I wanted to love it."
15_bj,2018-07-29,5,My new favorite!,"I had two or 3 pints of this before not being able to find it. It’s my new favorite after Coffee Heath Bar changed its ingredients and was no longer irresistible. The coffee flavor is a little different, not as sweet — and the truffles, true to their name, have a liquer flavor. Wonderful combination if you love coffee! I guess on one hand, I’m relieved not to be eating it regularly since losing weight has been easier, but I miss finding it on my grocery trips...please restock!!"
15_bj,2018-07-01,4,For espresso lovers,"I actually really loved the coffee flavor of this ice cream. My usual favorite is Coffee Coffee Buzz Buzz Buzz, but I can only ever find that in scoop shops (which I rarely patronize). The Chillin' the Roast Truffles was available at my grocery store so I pounced. It has a taste that people who enjoy dark roast coffee, plain cold brew, black coffee, or deep espressos will enjoy in my opinion. A lot of coffee ice creams just have a very mild coffee flavor you can barely detect beneath the plain sugar and cream flavor. This was true coffee and tasted excellent."
15_bj,2019-11-23,2,A better name would be chillin the tastebuds,"Got a small pint of this from a friend who thought I'd enjoy it due to me bei g both an avid lover of chocolate & an avid lover of coffee. I was super stoked to crack it open tonight and dive into the creamy dream the description promised, only to be disappointed. The ice cream was grainy, the fudge was entirely overpowered by bitter cold brew, & the truffles tasted of nothing but bitter coconut--I had to stop eating and double check the flavour listing to be sure I hadn't made a mistake. This blend missed the mark, but at least there's rum in it? Hopefully b&j Wil try again at a coffee & chocolate combo, & hopefully it will be better than this."
15_bj,2018-04-03,5,Very Impressive,"I bought it last night at Target, and I really enjoyed it! It's so yummy! the truffles were delicious & coffee liqueur really hit me, eating it slowly is the best definitely will be returning to get more"
15_bj,2018-09-20,5,Wow. Just...wow.,"Bold coffee flavor (more espresso bean than cold brew, I think, but I like it.) Thick fudgey truffles with a lovely top-shelf bourbon flavor. Oh my oh my. This is one delightful ice cream. Not for those who do not like whisky or strong coffee, but perfect for those who do."
15_bj,2018-09-09,5,Delicious,"I love this flavor. I am actually currently going back and forth between the caramel chocolate cheesecake truffle, and this one. If you LOVE Coffee, you'll love this. When you hit one of the truffles, it is like an explosion of delicious coffee liqueur on your tongue-and you get a little crunch from the cookie crumble, which all fits perfectly together. It is perfect for curling up and watching the latest episode of your favorite show, or even movie night."
15_bj,2018-03-07,3,Almost Perfect,"I'm a huge fan of coffee ice cream, and I've tried many different brands of coffee ice cream. When I picked up Chillin the Roast yesterday, I was amazed at first with the mocha taste. Then out of nowhere I get a huge coffee bean and it was so bitter and strong. It unbalances and overpowers The chocolate and the ice cream itself. It was really good, probably top 3 in my coffee ice cream suggestions. However I found myself avoiding the coffee bits after cringing while getting past the bitterness."
15_bj,2018-07-07,5,Make this a permanent flavor!,"First of all everyone should try ice cream flavors at least twice. I never pass judgement till I have something more than once.
I am kot a coffee addicted and I have to say that my significant other love this flavor. Great balance of flavors in the ingredients."
15_bj,2018-10-26,5,Love love love,Wish all stores that carry Ben & Jerry's have this flavor. I stopped going to my go-to grocery store just because they don't carry this flavor. This might be my favorite Ben & Jerry's ice cream. I like how it it not too sweet.
15_bj,2018-03-23,1,Weird Truffles,Just a misfire. The candy pieces are terrible tasting. Did not enjoy. Your boozy flavors tend to be bad.
15_bj,2018-04-29,3,Trouble with the Truffles,"I love the coffee ice cream but would like more chocolate swirl and no truffles at all. The truffles taste horrible. i can’t even describe what they taste like because I have never tasted anything like them. Rework it minus the truffles and I’m in but until then, it’s a no for me."
15_bj,2018-08-23,5,The flavor is to die for. Coffee lovers dream.,Decadent flavors not only with the coffee but the liqueur taste. Definetly and adults sweet paradise. Once you’ve had it nothing will be the same. A+++
15_bj,2018-05-04,2,Not my favorite,I was so excited when I got the e-mail about this - went to a scoop shop immediately to pick up hoping it would bring me back to my beloved Dublin Mudslide.
15_bj,2018-05-18,2,Terrible Truffles,"I love coffee with a passion! I also enjoy B&J’s ice cream from time to time. I was very excited after reading the title of this container, “Chillin’ the Roast Truffles”. Description is cold brew coffee, which I adore. I was very disappointed to find out the truffles in this container tastes like straight up coffee brandy liquor. I hate the truffles and for the first time in my life left this ice cream sitting in my freezer for a week, then ended up throwing it away. The ice cream itself was great!! It’s a no from me for the truffles."
15_bj,2019-01-07,4,Pretty Good,"DEFINITELY have to be a coffee lover to enjoy this! I absolutely love the flavor of the cold brew ice cream, tastes almost identical to chocolate covered espresso beans in my opinion. I think there should be just a little bit more swirl to help balance the coffee. The only thing I think I dont enjoy as much is the coffee liqueur truffles. On their own, the taste is very odd. However, if you eat them with the ice cream at the same time I think it works out. Definitely not my #1 favorite, but likely wont be the only time i have it."
15_bj,2018-09-02,1,So disappointing!,"I bought this a couple days ago thinking that I would venture away from my beloved Chunky Monkey and Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch and given that I usually love all things Ben & Jerry's fully expected to love this. I tried it the first night, took a few bites and immediately hated it only to try it again tonight thinking maybe it was a fluke but sadly it was not. This ice cream tastes so much like leftover coffee grounds both in flavor and texture that it wasn't even edible. This is the first time I've ever thrown out a pint uneaten."
15_bj,2018-05-24,2,Alcohol in this product,"Let me just say first off, this ice cream was absolutely delicious. I mean I LOVED it, until I found out that there was alcohol in it. I don’t drink alcohol and I wish there was some sort of warning on there. It didn’t taste cooked off (I hope it was)"
15_bj,2018-04-26,2,Subpar,"Like most people, I love Ben & Jerry's ice cream. There are so many wonderful flavors that I don't even have a go-to; I get something different every time! So of course, when I saw a new coffee flavor, I had to try it. However, for the first time, I was rather unsatisfied. The coffee ice cream itself was good, but, as others have said, the truffles are gross, and there is little to no chocolate swirl. This is one I'll be sure to never buy again."
15_bj,2018-04-02,5,amazing,"my new fav, its perf, dont know what them haterz be thinkin"
15_bj,2018-07-24,1,Unedible,I just tossed this in the trash! It is the worst flavor I have ever tried and I have tried alot! I have never met a Ben and Jerry's ice cream flavor I didn't like...until now. Dont waste your money! Buy coffee coffee buzz buzz or coffee and heath or anything else instead! I couldn't even swallow the truffles they were that bad. The rum flavor is so pungent! The ice cream flavor could be passable but the texture is grainy. Definately doesn't even deserve the 1 star as I threw it in the trash.
15_bj,2018-07-26,1,Hard Pass,"The cold brew ice cream was delicious! BUT the truffles were appalling. They were WAY to sweet and bitter. Just overpowering and offputing to where I couldn’t even finish half the pint. I’m a big coffee lover, but this ice cream was just a fail. Probably my least favorite Ben and Jerry’s flavor I’ve tried thus far."
15_bj,2018-10-08,5,Amazing! my new favorite!,"This has easily moved up to my new favorite! The icecream has a strong coffee flavor, and the taste is bold. If you don't like strong flavors it may not be for you. But for someone who has coffee in her veins it is perfect. The truffles and chocolate liquor and fudge swirls put it over the top!"
15_bj,2018-04-27,5,Perfect.,"Just bought some Chillin' the Roast and love it, would not change a thing. The ice cream tastes just like cold brew coffee so naturally you should enjoy coffee if you are buying this. The coffee liqueur-filled truffles are really good and are the perfect pair to the cold brew coffee ice cream."
15_bj,2018-07-01,3,"Ice cream flavor is great, truffles not so much","I love coffee and coffee ice cream, so I was really excited to try this and had high hopes. I was disappointed, sadly."
15_bj,2018-04-25,2,"Great Ice Cream, Terrible Truffles","The cold brew ice cream was great-really strong coffee flavor. The fudge swirls are also great and balance out the acidity of the coffee flavor, but the truffles are absolutely disgusting. I'd give it a higher rating, but there were so many truffles it was hard to get a bite without them. There's also not enough fudge swirls. If this didn't have the truffles it would be one of my favorite flavors."
15_bj,2020-06-10,1,Surprisingly terrible,Wow this was surprisingly terrible. Only are a few bites and didn't even want to eat anymore. Can't imagine how anyone would like this.
15_bj,2018-05-05,1,A HUGE Disappointment,"I love your coffee/chocolate combinations (Coffee Coffee Buzz Buzz is my favorite), but this one was nasty. I came to your website and the reviews for the first time ever (and I've been eating Ben and Jerry's forever), just to see if maybe I missed a hazelnut ingredient coating the truffles (I hate hazelnut). Or something that didn't belong. The coffee ice cream was awesome, until (I guess) I bit into a truffle. Ugh. I actually just tossed $5 of ice cream into the trash."
15_bj,2019-06-07,1,"Grainy, bland ice cream base","The ice cream base was grainy, as if product had melted and been refrozen. It didn't taste like coffee. It tasted like grainy ice milk with a mild and bland flavor. I couldn't comment on the truffles, as other reviewers have, because the sandy texture of the base - neither creamy nor tasty -was so disappointing I put it back in my freezer after three bites. I am hoping my local grocer will offer a refund. This pint was a terrible disappointment!"
15_bj,2018-04-20,1,Disappointed,"I was so hoping to find a new favorite coffee ice cream, but the texture was a bit more grainy than usual, and I was shocked by the truffles... wow they were so strong! They tasted like an unnatural chemical. I had my husband try it and he had to spit it out. So sad! We love B&J’s!"
15_bj,2018-05-25,5,Best Coffee Ice Cream EVER!,"I love coffee and was very excited to see this new flavor at the grocery store. I couldn't wait to get home and try it and to say the least I was not disappointed. Hands down the best coffee ice cream I have ever tried. I have already retuned to get more. Love it, love it, love it. Well done Ben & Jerry's!!"
15_bj,2019-12-13,2,"I'll finish the pint, but probably won't buy again","Since I had just finished a pint of ""Coffee, Coffee, Buzz Buzz Buzz"" I figured I would try this one. They are incredibly different in every way, from color to taste to ingredients, so I wouldn't compare the two. I would like the ice cream on its own, the cold brew ice cream would be good with chocolate chips as a iced-mocha flavor concept. But with these truffles, listed as ""chocolate-cookie covered liqueur truffles"", the chocolate (which tastes just like chocolate, not sure where the cookie is), does not stay attached to the truffle inside. The liqueur truffle itself is the consistency of cookie butter, I was expecting the something harder. They definitely give a bit of a kick, which may not be what you are into. I plan on finishing the pint, but I think I have to be in the mood for it and it won't be the first thing in the fridge that I reach for."
15_bj,2019-03-05,1,Dont buy,"I bought this because they were out of buzz,buzz,buzz. I didn't know there was a way to mess up coffee icecream but this is it."
15_bj,2018-12-27,5,My new favorite!,"I loved everything about this flavor and I think it may have replaced Cherry Garcia as my new favorite. I like the heavy coffee flavoring of the ice cream — it’s a bolder coffee flavor than previous Ben & Jerry’s offerings. It’s sweet without being too sweet, which gives the gooey chocolate swirl ample room to shine AND some added sweetness from the gloriously boozy truffles. I’m gonna need to get another pint of this soon!"
15_bj,2018-04-26,2,Missed the mark,"The ice cream itself and chocolate swirl are great, but the truffles... ooh boy. This is the first BJ review I have ever given, and I actually came to the website to see if I had gotten a bad batch, or if everyone else had the same reaction to this flavor. Bitter and sour taste."
15_bj,2018-03-24,1,So disappointing!,"I always look forward to new flavors so I had to try this one. I have to say that this is the worst flavor I have ever tried! Weak coffee flavor, no sign of a chocolate swirl and the truffles were inedible. This is the first pint of Ben and Jerry’s that I could not finish."
15_bj,2018-03-27,5,Best appreciated by TRUE coffee addicts,"I thought this flavor was AMAZING. Though I’m not a huge coffee liquer fan, you get exactly what they advertise. I thought the truffles complimented the overall flavor, which is definitely overwhelmingly deliciously rich strong coffee. Love it, new favorite for sure."
15_bj,2018-12-31,1,Textures and Tastes Way Off,"I normally love Ben and Jerry's, and coffee is my weakness... this though. Just a miss. I didn't care for the taste or the texture of the truffles-- very weird. I agree around them for a whole, but ultimately threw away more of the pint than its ever have imagined. The swirls were alright, but the gritty texture of the coffee grounds in the ice cream was way too much for me. Sorry, guys. This was not a winner."
15_bj,2018-06-09,2,"Actual ice cream, delicious. Truffles are a fail.","I was torn between the two new truffle flavors, and decided to go with this one. The cold brew coffee ice cream is a LITTLE grainy but not like others I’ve had. The texture of the truffles was nice, but the flavor was a total turn off. I ended up eating around them until they were too hard to avoid. Then I threw the rest away. Granted, I’m not a booze person, but the truffle flavor was truly acrid. Too bad!"
15_bj,2018-04-23,1,The only flavor I can’t eat,"I love Ben & Jerry’s and I love coffee, but the coffee liquor “truffles” are strong and nasty. And it tastes like crushed coffee beans throughout the ice cream and not in a good way. Hardly any chocolate (at least not in the pint I purchased). I never say this, (but this is an exception), this flavor is a flop."
15_bj,2020-08-24,3,Not a great combo,"I bought this simply because the flavor I REALLY wanted wasn't on the shelf and I figured ""why not?"" The description on front sounded great but I was slightly disappointed to find light colored ice cream when I took off the lid (I don't care for vanilla) but one bite in, I was a fan. The cold-brew coffee flavor is powerful and is even better than the flavor of ice cream in Coffee BuzzBuzzBuzz! And the fudge swirls match that flavor perfectly. But what I found did not fit well were the truffles. They added a bitter taste and I found they did not mesh well with the other flavors. I figured I could just eat around them or scoop them out. Sadly, the shells are to fragile and broke when I tried this. After 15 mins of trying to avoid their bitterness, I ended up throwing the pint away. I was able to enjoy about a quarter of the ice cream and fudge. Awesome effort but needs adjustment (imo.)"
15_bj,2018-03-26,3,"Best B&J's Coffee Base, But Not a Fan of Truffles","Cold brew base is more of an espresso type, studded with flecks of coffee. This is the best coffee base I've ever tasted by B&J. Then, you get a bite of truffle. The coffee liqueur filling is overpowering; you should really, really like coffee liqueur to enjoy these. For me, they ruined the pint"
15_bj,2019-05-26,5,A special occasion flavor for adults,"This is for adults. This is delicious. This may be my favorite flavor in decades, but it is a flavor to be savored and even thought about. It's very complex, and you should enjoy it at various temperatures to get all the coffee flavors. The texture is relatively simple, and the chocolate around the truffles could be slightly darker and nicer, but bravo to whoever put this recipe together."
15_bj,2018-05-21,5,Coffee liqueur & chocolate!,"I just finished off a pint I got this week. I had been looking for a decadent chocolate flavor when I found this
instead. As a coffee lover who rarely drinks alcohol, I do love coffee flavored liqueur. This ice cream had just the right amount of chocolate around the liqueur truffles. The focus was on the coffee and liqueur, rather than the chocolate, and it’s instantly become my new fav!"
15_bj,2018-10-20,1,"Great ice cream flavor, terrible truffles.","The showcase of this ice cream should be the truffles, however the ice cream is really what makes this product ok. The ice cream is beautifully executed however, the truffles are rather disgusting. The chocolate fudge is excellent. I found myself throwing out the truffles and unable to finish, it just was awful running into the truffles. They have a very bad flavor that is unpalatable."
15_bj,2019-05-02,1,Threw It In The Garbage,"This flavor is so bad that Chillin' the Roast is the first pint of Ben & Jerry's that I ever threw in the garbage. It has a very odd, un-ice-cream like texture and weird flavors. It's kind of foamy and the flavors are so strange that I can't even describe them. I looked at the ingredients and it's full of gums, carrageenan, canola and soybean oils and 'natural flavors'. Mystery solved."
15_bj,2018-07-28,1,Not for me. Probably not you either.,"I actually accidentally grabbed a pint of this, I was want the Chocolate Cheesecake Truffle. I got messed up by the both being truffle ice cream! However I was already home when I realized it. The taste of this ice cream is horrible. It's souer and the coffee over powers everything else. I only ate a few spoons and I was done. Probably the worst ice cream I've ever tasted."
15_bj,2018-03-08,2,"Weak coffee flavor, invisible fudge swirl","Picked up this, because I love really good coffee ice cream, and a pint of Phish Food. Good thing I had the Phish Food, because this has weak, milky coffee ice cream, had no visible fudge swirls, and the coffee liqueur truffles tasted more like butterscotch. You guys need to tase some of your premium ice cream competitors coffee ice cream, or call this one ""Cafe au Lait""."
15_bj,2019-05-26,1,Unfortunate Flavor,I love cold brew coffee and I love coffee ice creams. The truffles were a huge let down and didn't really taste much like coffee and had a weird alcohol liqeur thing going on. Also there was a air pocket in the bottom of my pint so I was missing about a quarter of product. I wish my local stores carried the other coffee flavors because this one did not meet the mark.
15_bj,2018-04-20,1,Not What I Expected,Not good. The coffee liquor truffles taste weird and the overall flavor doesn’t mesh with all the flavors. Very disappointed and I love all B&J flavors.
15_bj,2018-05-31,1,I love Ben and Jerry's EXCEPT THIS FLACOR,This is one of the only flavors i've thrown into the trash. Don't waste your time. Eat any other wonder flavor they have... just not this mess.
15_bj,2018-06-20,5,Coffee ice cream done right just for grown ups,It isn’t amazing if you really like something complex and sweet and you are a fan of coffee you will love it. I see negative reviews but they were looking for something more standard they have their expectations for coffee flavored Ice cream. This is my favorite commercial ICe cream. It isn’t overly sweet and it has coffee and alcohol and chocolate it’s perfect!
15_bj,2018-07-01,5,Fantastic - best new flavor in *years*,"This is a wonderful alternative to flavors often geared towards an overly sweet American pallet. The texture, taste and flavor combinations are incredible. This is the first Ben & Jerry's review I've ever left, and this is the flavor that compelled me to do so!"
15_bj,2018-04-29,1,Big let down,the icecream and fudge swirls taste amazing but the truffles are so revolting i litterally almost through up i would rather you guys bring back coffee coffee buzz buzz then continue this flavor as the biggest part of the icecream is the worst part... if you want to fix it get rid of the coffee liquer truffles and rreplace it with something expresso
15_bj,2020-03-26,1,Horrible,"I picked this up at the grocery store the other day. I had never seen it before and the description sounded amazing. The cold brew ice cream itself is amazing, but those liquor truffles are terrible. They have this over powering salty, alcohol caramel taste to them. I tried to eat around them but I eventually just threw it away. So disappointed!"
15_bj,2018-10-28,2,Super unexpected,"I saw this ice cream and though it both looked and sounded amazing. Although the ice cream itself is yummy coffee deliciousness, those cookie-covered chocolate chunks are god awful. Or at least just not for me. The coffee flavor is very overwhelming and not at all what i expected. I tried suffering through but i couldn't. I'm disappointed lol"
15_bj,2018-02-25,3,Not bad,The coffee ice cream is ok! But the coffee liqueur bites are kinda butterscotch heavy!
15_bj,2018-05-12,1,Disappointed,"I was so excited to see a coffee flavor, as it is one of my favorites. When I opened the carton, a wonderful coffee scent was released. Then the taste test. The ice cream and the fudge were fine, but the “truffles” were gross. I can’t describe the flavor, but it was very unpleasant. I doubt I’ll eat any more then the small sample I had."
15_bj,2018-09-03,5,New Favorite Flavor!,I've always loved coffee ice cream and liqueur chocolates so for me this flavor was a huge hit. I first got it a few months back then had trouble finding it in stock again until now and was totally stoked to buy it again. Apparently it's a love it or hate it flavor so I would say try it for yourself. Don't let the haters change you B&J
15_bj,2018-06-13,5,Coffee Ice Cream Like I've Never Had It Before,"This is an outstanding flavor that really re-imagines what can be done with coffee ice cream. I've had 3 pints already and I've only known about this flavor for a week! Some people have said the truffles taste weird, but I think they add a very unique flavor and this flavor should be kept as-is. I know I'll be buying it!"
15_bj,2018-05-20,5,Coffee and crunchies=Bliss,"I picked this up this morning at the grocery. It's gone. One sitting. I'm not a super-sweet eater, but I broke the rules for this. Coffee flavor, then the liqueur taste...plus some crunchy yumminess to chew on. I am tempted to run to the store and buy the rest to deep freeze for when they take it out of circulation."
15_bj,2019-02-13,1,Awful alcohol taste,"I bought this because I love coffee and chocolate, but the truffles made me gag! The truffles made the ice cream INEDIBLE. I did not know there was alcohol in this flavor and wish it would have been more obviously stated on the package as I do not drink. This has seriously broken my trust with Ben & Jerry's."
15_bj,2018-05-01,4,Pretty good,"I loved the cold brew ice cream and the chocolate cookie crust, however the coffee liqueur truffle inside the cookie crust was super sweet and I could only handle about 2 chunks. After a while I just scooped those chunks of the truffle itself out of its crust and set them aside and tasted much better."
15_bj,2019-06-04,2,Tastes fuzzy,I usually love any Ben & Jerry's but unfortunately this is a big miss - I don't know any better way to describe it than to say it tastes kind of fuzzy. I'd rather have coffee flavored ice cream than the cold brew grounds even if the flavor is stronger. And the truffles are as bad as people say. Yikes.
15_bj,2018-11-21,5,A+++,Normally I can only eat a tiny amount of Ben and Jerry’s. I almost devoured this pint in one sitting. The malt flavor reminds me of the tiny malt cups with the wooden spoon that I would get from the ice cream man as a kid. Absolutely in love with this flavor. And mash mellow in there too!
15_bj,2018-05-27,5,Finally the return of a REAL coffee flavor to B&J!,Not since Aztec Harvest coffee has there been an ice cream flavor that has a good STRONG coffee flavor. Thank you B&J for finally fulfilling this much needed gap in the ice cream world! Only thing I'd love even more is a smooth mix-in free Espresso ice cream and I can die a happy man. :)
15_bj,2018-06-19,1,Swing and a miss,For me this flavor was a miss. The ice cream was gritty and the truffles tasted a little too boozy. I think the flavor combo could work with some adjustments but I won't be trying this one again. I'm still a Ben & Jerry's fan and will not hold one disappointing flavor against them.
15_bj,2018-07-16,5,Definitely for true coffee lovers!,"I personally loved this new flavor. The coffee flavor is pretty strong and so are the coffee liquor truffles. I would definitely buy this ice cream flavor again. But if you’re not into that strong coffee flavor, I wouldn’t go for this one. Otherwise, definitely try it out! :)"
15_bj,2018-06-13,1,Disappointing,Generally speaking I have loved trying new flavors but this one just didn't live up to my expectations. It had an odd aftertaste and the texture just wasn't appealing. Hoping the kids are less picky and will consume the rest of the pint otherwise it is getting tossed.
15_bj,2018-07-27,1,Alcohol and ice cream don’t mix,"I bought this last night, seeing truffles in the title I was excited to try it. The part that I missed was the liqueur in it. Talk about gross... that may be the only time I’ve ever said that about a Ben and Jerry’s flavor... as I sit here in my Ben and Jerry’s shirt."
15_bj,2018-04-11,3,"Love the Ice Cream, Hate the Truffles","I am a BIG coffee toffee bar crunch girl, and I haven’t been able to find it in my new city so I got this when I saw it. The ice cream is pretty good (4/5) but everytime I eat a truffle I feel like I’m taking a shot- they’re SO STRONG. I would prefer a normal truffle."
15_bj,2019-03-12,5,I fell in love with Ben and Jerry's again,"Because of this flavor, well, the title says it all. It is my new favorite and I buy multiple containers in the store whenever i see it, especially when I'm not even intending on buying ice cream that day. No stores near me sell it and I wish more stores carried it."
15_bj,2019-10-01,1,"Very fake flavor in truffles, almost threw it away","I bought this at my local grocery, and typically love coffee flavored treats from Ben & Jerrys, but the truffle bombs in this were just not good, the flavoring was overly artificial and almost antiseptic. Would have been better with a caramel swirl and no truffles!"
15_bj,2018-02-23,5,So Yummy!,This tastes like a frappuccino! It is bold in its flavor.
15_bj,2018-04-15,4,Perfectly balanced,Really good. If you love coffee you will love this flavor. Every element of this flavor went together perfectly. the fudge swirls help balance the strong truffles. the base icecream is the winner in this pint though! best coffee flavor by far from Ben and Jerrys.
15_bj,2018-11-21,5,Excellent!,I love this flavor! It has a nice strong coffee flavor. The truffles go really well with the cold brew ice cream and the chocolate swirl adds the perfect amount of sweetness. I also love that it has little specs of coffee grounds ❤️ Perfect for any coffee lover!
15_bj,2018-03-26,5,My new favorite,"My husband bought a pint of this and, on a whim because I don’t eat much ice cream, I tried a bit."
15_bj,2018-03-12,5,A replacement for the Coffee Heath bar switcharoo,Good coffee flavor and the little bites have a liquor flavor thats not overpowering. This is a good replacement for the ruined Coffee Heath bar after they removed the heath bar and substituted with some non goo garbage. Great job folks
15_bj,2018-04-25,4,overall I really like it,My favorite part is the coffee ice cream. Just the right amount of bitter to compensate for the sweetness of the chocolate swirls. My only issue is the flavor of the truffles. Its too much. Too bitter. It doesn't work well with the rest of the flavors.
15_bj,2018-05-27,5,Coffee coffee coffee,"So. Incredibly. Good.
I don't know how those master minds did it but they captured the smell of a coffee shop. When I eat this ice cream I feel like I'm walking through a shopping mall and begin to catch the smell of coffee goodness drifting about."
15_bj,2018-10-22,5,My new favorite,"I’m not even a particularly big coffee fan, but this flavor is AWESOME. I hope it sticks around. It’s easily in my top 3 all time favorites, and I think it would be a smart move to keep it given the ever-rising popularity of cold brew coffee."
15_bj,2019-02-18,1,Sadly disappointed,"I decided to try a new flavor because the idea sounded good, but it did not meet expectations of Ben & Jerry’s! The actual coffee flavored ice cream is good, but the truffles taste gross. Was this even taste tested before distribution??"
15_bj,2019-03-04,5,Great authentic coffee flavor,"This is by far my favorite! I love the delicious, true coffee flavor and the truffles are to die for. As a bona fide coffee junkie, I heartily recommend this ice cream! Now if only I could get it in a larger quantity than a pint..."
15_bj,2019-04-28,5,Chillin' In All The Right Ways!,"This is my new favorite. I was a huge White Russian fan and this is now my Treat Night go to. The coffee flavor is smooth and mellow, a slight bit of liquor and the textures of dark chocolate, this all dances on the tongue. I smile!"
15_bj,2018-07-04,5,Bold & Creamy with Delicate Truffles,"Delish! Bold coffee flavor balanced with creamy texture and melt in your mouth truffles, love it! I'm in Starbucks country where us Seattleites like our coffee treats strong so this hits the spot. Pleeeease make a non-dairy version"
15_bj,2019-06-12,5,Coffee and crispy chocolate YUM,We just found the Chillin the Roast Truffles this week. The coffee flavor is rich and creamy. The chocolate cookie-covered coffee liqueur truffles are flavor packed and delicious. And swirls of fudge all through. We love it!
15_bj,2019-03-15,2,Good Idea...but execution not so much,I wanted to like this so much. If you only had the ice cream and more fudge swirl I think this would be better. Thise coffee liqueur cookie truffles ruined the ice cream. And the fudge swirl was almost non-existent in my pint.
15_bj,2018-12-13,2,Interesting...,"The ice cream itself was okay for coffee lovers. The truffles were really yucky though, and I like coffee liqueur. Something just didn't taste right. And then the fudge swirls weren't good either! I could only have a few bites"
15_bj,2019-03-22,5,Mouth watering truffles,Excited to find this new coffee flavor. Each bite was better than the last. The truffles were an extra bonus of thick chocolate and a creamy center. So delicious I will be requesting it to be stocked in my home town market.
15_bj,2018-05-03,1,So bad,Picjed this up when store didnt have brewed to matter. Super disapointed. Coffee flavor was okay. The rum and truffles was horrible. Rum was overpowering and super gross I had to toss this. Bring backmdublin mudslide.
15_bj,2018-06-09,5,Incredible,I don’t understand all the negative reviews regarding the truffles tasting alcoholic. It says on the label that it contains liqueur! And boy does it deliver! I mean who could say no to caffeine and alcohol in an ice cream?
15_bj,2018-08-12,5,I'm in love,As someone who drinks alot of coffee this is amazing. it's sweet enough to counter balance the cold brew but the flavors still taste the coffee. The cookie bite help make it the go to I'm having a bad day.
15_bj,2018-06-12,1,Don’t waste your time,The coffee ice cream in this flavor is so so but the truffles have a distinctly awful flavor. I ended up trying to pick around them and then just throwing it out. Definitely would never buy this again
15_bj,2018-05-18,1,Not good,"This is just not good. For the first time ever, I ate a few bites and threw the rest away. The coffee ice cream itself is ok, but not with the combination of other flavors in there. I'm disappointed."
15_bj,2019-01-24,5,Delicious!,"You guys still havent brought back Dublin Mudslide but this is an awfully steong competitor! I’m just having some trouble getting my hands on a second pint here in Brooklyn, NY. Happy scooping!"
15_bj,2018-06-25,5,Best coffee flavor ever,"Ive been eating coffee icecream for almost 40 years. When I was little you could only find it in New England. This is by far my favorite coffee icecream, they nailed it. Hope it sticks around."
15_bj,2018-04-13,5,"I've never had a favorite ice cream, until now!","From the first bite of Chillin' the Roast Truffles, my World was changed. 36 years and I've never come close to having a favorite Ice Cream. Bravo, Ben & Jerry, this flavour is a triumph!"
15_bj,2019-04-05,1,Horrible,I normally love your ice cream but this was a huge disappointment. Super bitter tasting and the feeling of coffee grounds with every bite. The flavor of the truffles were extremely strong.
15_bj,2020-01-03,5,So Good!,"I am so sad that this is clearanced aty local grocery storeI find it really delicious, with a strong coffee liqueur flavor that is not overshadowed by the sweet richness of the chocoate."
15_bj,2018-12-22,5,Best ice cream ever,"This nice cream is my ultimate favorite. Its absolutely amazing. The cold brew ice cream hits the spot every time, and biting into a coffee liquor truffle is just divine. I am addicted."
15_bj,2019-01-23,1,I had to throw it out,"I had to throw it out, Which is very sad because I love Ben & Jerry’s and this is the first flavor that I just could not stomach. The coffee Lacore is just too much it’s offputting"
15_bj,2018-05-22,5,Coffee lover!!!!,"Love this stuff! After a competitor stopped making my favorite ice cream, I found this and I'm so glad I did! It's now my favorite ice cream. Don't ever stop making this...YUM!!!!"
15_bj,2018-05-02,1,Tossed it in the trash!,"My husband is an ice cream lover, he will eat almost any flavor, even if he isn't crazy about it. He tossed this in the trash because it's just that awful! I hated it too."
15_bj,2020-02-07,5,Best Flavor,Next to the sadly retired Wavy Gravy ( I am still sad) Chillin the Roast may be my favorite! I am frustrated however because I am finding it difficult to locate in stores.
15_bj,2018-06-13,5,so good,this is the first coffee ice cream i've had that astes like actual coffee was so excited when i saw it and definitely lived up to my expectations!!! my new favorite!!!
15_bj,2020-08-27,5,My favorite flavor of ice cream EVER,I always need some in the freezer! I’m sad that none of my grocery stores sell it anymore though. I can’t find it anywhere. :’( Still the ice cream love of my life!
15_bj,2018-09-14,5,The ONLY coffee ice cream I truly enjoy,"I love coffee but everytime I tried coffee flavored ice cream, I've always been disappointed. Until NOW! Thank you Ben and Jerry's for this awesome new flavor!!"
15_bj,2020-01-27,5,FOR COFFEE LOVERS ONLY,i cant find this flavor anywhere!! i think its because not many people like it but i love it! its for true coffee lovers only! PLEASE PUT IT BACK IN STORES!!!!
15_bj,2019-09-01,5,Truffletastic!,This has quickly taken over as my favorite B&J ice cream flavor! I freakin love it! The only thing that could make it better is more truffles! Omg SO GOOD!
15_bj,2018-06-24,5,Amazon flavor,Great coffee flavor that is complimented by the coffee liqueur truffles. Has that beautiful chocolate flavor but the coffee is not overpowered by sweetness
15_bj,2019-08-04,1,deeply disappointed,"It kind of tastes like Baileys, but gross. I’ve never been disappointed by Ben or Jerry until tonight. Still love them, but my heart and stomach hurt."
15_bj,2018-06-23,4,it's alright.,"The coffee bits are so concentrated, it tastes like alcohol. But if you add chocolate syrup, it balances it out enough for me to where I can enjoy it."
15_bj,2019-02-24,2,Great coffee flavor but too much liquor flavor,Love the coffee ice cream but the truffle chunks taste like straight up alcohol.... it put a damper on what could’ve been an amazing ice cream.
15_bj,2020-02-05,5,My favorite!,I bought this many times and it is one of my favorite flavors they have come out with. I have been so disappointed I cant find it any more!
15_bj,2019-11-25,2,"Ice cream yes, truffles no",I have never met a B&J flavor I didn’t like. Until now. The truffles ruined it for me - a nasty burst of bitter. So disappointed. :(
15_bj,2018-05-19,2,Not as good as other coffee flavors,Coffee base tastes kind of watered down. Truffles are overpowering and not very tasty in comparison. First pint I failed to finish.
15_bj,2018-03-20,3,It's likeable,"I love the cold brew ice cream because I love coffee grinds. But I did not care for the truffles, they are extremely overpowering."
15_bj,2020-01-18,5,Coffee with chocolate truffle goodness!,I tried this on a whim and I’m so glad that I did. It’s delicious! Sweet cookie truffles in coffee ice cream. Absolutely divine!
15_bj,2018-03-06,5,So yummy!,"The ratio of truffle to ice cream is perfect. I love the spin on the coffee ice cream flavor, i hope this one is here to stay!!!"
15_bj,2018-09-05,5,Coffee Lovers Unite!,Whoever thinks this flavor is gross is CRAZY! Guess you have to be a true coffee lover to appreciate how DELICIOUS this is!!
15_bj,2018-05-17,5,BEST ONE YET,"Perfect mix of all my favorite things! I’m a huge fan of coffee icecream but also chocolate, and this is the perfect combo."
15_bj,2018-05-03,5,Coffee Lover,I have purchased this flavor twice. Its hard to find but GR8 to eat. I totally loved it! It for the true coffee lovers....
15_bj,2018-10-02,1,Way too bitter,"I like coffee flavored products, but this was way too bitter for my liking. Also not a fan of the whole Truffle gimmick."
15_bj,2018-06-09,5,Yummy!!,"I just bought this today. I love it! Coffee is one of my favorite flavors of ice cream, this did not disappoint!!"
15_bj,2018-05-08,5,My favorite flavor EVER!,"Delicious! I love the texture of the truffles. Unfortunately, not available everywhere
Or at least not yet!"
15_bj,2020-04-07,5,Excellent Blend of ingredients,I got this a year ago and feel in love right away. Jut wish I could find more and more. The best flavor yet.
15_bj,2018-11-12,3,Great coffee flavor but...,The coffee flavor is amazing but the truffle had a to strong of after taste. The fudge was spot on as well.
15_bj,2019-04-07,5,heavenly,A coffee party in your mouth! I just saw these were clearanced at Walmart. I HOPE they're not going away
15_bj,2018-02-21,5,Great Flavor,Taste absolutely amazing. I absolutely love the coffee truffle pits in my ice along with amazing flavor.
15_bj,2018-09-07,5,Yummy liquer flavor! Very intense coffee taste!,"Bought this to try something new! Wasn’t expecting much from the coffee, Exceeded my expectations!"
15_bj,2018-06-21,5,Much better than the 3.2 score it's getting 062118,"Had this yesterday, thoroughly impressed. Much more then other flavors getting much higher scores."
15_bj,2018-05-10,1,Way off the mark.,The truffles were soggy & disgusting and did not compliment the already off flavored ice cream.
15_bj,2018-04-19,5,Ice Cream for Adults,Great complex flavor combination that just works. I really hope this one sticks around.
15_bj,2020-07-24,5,great taste！,"This my favorite ice cream. However, I could not find it this year. Is it discontinued?"
15_bj,2018-05-03,5,Great Flavor,It's the best Ben and Jerry ice cream hands down. However it's really hard to find :(
15_bj,2018-10-06,1,Very Dissatisfied,Ice cream was bland and the liqueur truffles were disgusting. Had to pick them out!
15_bj,2019-04-18,5,Delicious,All the things I want in ice cream. If I can’t have Festivus anymore I’ll take this.
15_bj,2019-01-18,5,Love it,Love Chillin the Roast Truffles . Also love coffee toffee crunch and phish food
15_bj,2018-04-02,1,Just Plain Weird,"The texture is odd, really grainy. The truffle flavour is strong but unpleasant."
15_bj,2018-08-19,5,Best evvvver!!!,"A combo of the best ingredients ever!!
Coffee + chocolate + liquor = amazing!!"
15_bj,2020-03-05,5,BRING THIS BACK,This is one my favorites from the truffle series! Target refuses to carry it!
15_bj,2019-01-21,4,Great Job!,A superb blend of flavors and textures! I thoroughly enjoyed this ice cream!
15_bj,2019-03-02,5,Whoa!!,This is the most amazing ice cream I’ve ever enjoyed!! A true masterpiece!!
15_bj,2018-12-03,1,Had high hopes,Disappointed. To sum up the flavor in one word ... Ashtray.
15_bj,2018-04-11,2,"Good ice cream, bad truffles.","The ice cream was really tasty, but the truffles ruin it."
15_bj,2018-06-08,5,This is awesome!!!!!!,"It’s everything I want in an ice cream , it’s so good!!"
15_bj,2018-06-08,5,My life is complete!,"Truffles bring big, deep flavor. Hits all flavor notes."
15_bj,2018-06-14,5,So good,New favorite flavor. Would recommend to coffee lovers.
15_bj,2018-08-29,5,Fantastic flavors!,"Saw it at the store, got it, and going back for more."
15_bj,2018-05-07,3,Disappointed,"Not my favorite, the coffee flavor was kind of strong"
15_bj,2018-05-07,5,Delicious!!!,This flavor was simply delicious is all I can say!!!
15_bj,2018-05-21,5,Fav Ice Cream Of All-Times!!!!!,I Simply Love It Please Keep Forever And Ever!!!!!!!
15_bj,2018-06-11,1,Terrible,Threw it away without finishing it. Honestly awful
16_bj,2018-05-08,2,Hey Ben and Jerry where is my cookie dough?,"Always have loved your chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, my husband knows this and came home with some. Well it takes very little to excite me these days but after a day of errands, housework, homework, dinner then getting son to bed all I kept thinking of, was that small tub of heaven in my freezer. So finally I put on some Guilty pleasure reality television snugged into my couch with my favorite blanket and my favorite ice cream only to notice that after a couple spoonfuls......NO COOKIE DOUGH! This can’t be correct NOOOOOOOOO!! First I was really doubting I was smarter than a fifth grader and now NO COOKIE DOUGH! Not the ending I needed to this day!"
16_bj,2017-10-24,1,Expensive vanilla ice cream - Where's the dough?,Mine does not look like the example photo... there was barely any cookie dough! I basically just paid over £4 for a tub of vanilla ice cream. Very disappointing.
16_bj,2017-07-17,2,"Plenty of dough, no chips","I've bought this a number of times. Usually there is not enough dough, lately there's been enough dough but it not's equally distributed. Lots of bites of just plain vanilla.
Maybe you should take whatever quantity of dough being used and make the balls smaller - that way the dough can be more evenly spread throughout the ice cream. Most of the dough seems to end up at the bottom on the pint. You're definitely not using the same amount of chips as in the picture. I'm okay with not getting dough in very bite, but want chips in very bite. Lately the price seems to be much cheaper than it use to be....is that the reason for less chips or dough?"
16_bj,2018-04-06,5,Favorite Since Childhood,"Ben & Jerry's Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough ice cream has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid. I always appreciated the rich vanilla ice cream and chunks of flavorful cookie dough (the dough isn't dry and flavorless like some other cookie dough ice creams). Sometimes you don't want a busy ice cream with too many extras and this is perfect. I usually go into it with the goal of only eating half the container, but always end up finishing it in one sitting. Classic, reliable, and delicious."
16_bj,2019-07-19,3,Whered the chocolate chip chunks go!?,"Ive eatten this ice cream before, considering its the only non dairy i enjoy. I have gotten this as my favorite one out of the flavors so many times and never have i had this happen. Its good till november 13 2020. Todays date is july 2019. As you can see in the photo below....its just vanilla with cookie dough bites in it....WHY!? Im not that upset it still tastes good. I just hope it was processed right and not a recall of some sort and still put out on shelves."
16_bj,2017-10-14,1,Only 1 small dime sized piece of cookie dough,"I NEVER review anything, especially not food. But I live in Canada where this ice cream can run up to $10!! Wayyyyy more than other brands but you hope to get what you pay for. There was one small piece of cookie dough on the top, zero other pieces in the entire tub. The texture was weird and icy. I've had the same kind before and it was way better. With a brand this $$$ a consumer expects consistency. I will be switching to another brand from here on out."
16_bj,2017-07-03,1,Disappointed...,"I just opened a pint of this last week and was disappointed in the quality of the cookie dough. Unlike a lot of the other reviewers, mine had enough of the cookie dough, but the dough tasted old and was too hard. I tried leaving it to sit out for a while to see if it had just needed to thaw a bit, but that did not do the trick."
16_bj,2017-08-28,1,So disappointed,"Ben and jerrys cookie dough has always been my favourite Ice cream, hate to admit but I can eat up to 3 tubs a week = £15 a week! My last 3 tubs have been disgusting, with an icy texture and the dough bits crumbly and biscuit like as opposed to the usual doughy texture. Will not be buying again as 3 times for this to happen is more than enough. I have the full 3 tubs in the freezer as they were completely inedible, ready to take back to the retailer to complain tomorrow but I'm guessing they are going to take it up with you guys."
16_bj,2018-11-10,1,Disappointing! Where is the Cookie Dough?!,"After trying B&Js for the first time (Half Baked which was absolutely DELICIOUS), I became a recent fan and had to come back and try their Cookie Dough flavour. Well, what a complete waste of money! I am well aware that B&J has always been more expensive than other ice cream brands (especially living in Australia) but have always been happy to pay more for a premium product. Little did I know, I would open my tub to discover next to no cookie dough in the whole thing! What's the point of having a couple of teeny millimeter specks? Why pay more for this product when you can get perfectly fine vanilla ice cream from a competitor at a lower cost?! My last experience with Half Baked was amazing but now I'm personally unsure whether I will repurchase a B&J product again as I don't want to repeat this experience of buyers remorse and utter disappointment."
16_bj,2017-06-09,1,Normally great but...,"I love Ben and Jerry's chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream. It helps me relax after a rough day. But, the most recent pint I bought the cookie dough was hard and brittle and dry? I don't know how to describe it but it was weird and not the norm. Even the ice cream itself had a chalkiness to it. So disappointing since it's a splurge to purchase Ben and Jerry's as a grad student on a budget."
16_bj,2018-06-21,5,Love the dough,"I love Ben & Jerry’s Cookie Dough. I just crushed yet another pint of it and yet again, I loved every spoonful of it! The ice cream is rich and delicious and the dough globs are ridiculous! So good that I eat it with a toddler spoon so I take smaller bites. My goal one day is to combine a pint of this with a pint of chocolate fudge brownie for a double half baked!!"
16_bj,2018-09-23,2,Cookie dough wasn't dough-y,"I rarely indulge in Ben & Jerry's, but when I do, I go for the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. Unfortunately, my most recent experience was less than satisfying. The pieces of dough felt like they were missing a few ingredients. Instead of having that really amazing soft, chewy, dough texture... they tasted like dough powder. It was dry and bland. Did the formula change or are you guys still having issues with manufacturing?"
16_bj,2017-10-25,5,Don't believe the bad reviews like I did!!!,"Not sure what the bad reviewers are on, but give me two please! This stuff is the real deal. I've literally tried all the other brands of Choc Cookie Dough and in the trash they went. I buy maybe 3 of these a week at least. Too hard to walk past. B and J is all that and more. Love you guys and your product! ps. there's always plenty of cookie dough, must be a factory issue. I've always had it packed full of dough and it's been a long time.."
16_bj,2017-05-27,2,"Where's the ""GLOBS""","I usually love Ben and Jerry's and buy it for a special treat. Today I bought the Cholcoate Chip Cookie Dough and was sooooo looking forward to the promised ""Globs"" of cookie dough. Sad to say in the whole pint (yes, I planned on eating all of it) there were only 7 smallish balls of cookie dough... overall, the taste of the ice cream is great however, the experience became a game of hunt and peck rather than the enjoyment I was looking for. Next time I'll opt for Brownie Batter Core, lol."
16_bj,2019-01-15,5,Underrated,"Maybe it's not the most exciting flavor, but the contrast of the plain (but very good) vanilla ice cream and the ambrosia-like cookie dough chunks makes this flavor one of the most enjoyable to eat. You just have to beat the temptation to dig out every bite of cookie dough before you eat the rest of the ice cream! I've tried many kinds of cookie dough ice cream and this has by far the best cookie dough (and ice cream for that matter) of all of them."
16_bj,2020-05-28,4,,"Super big chunks of cookie dough, tons of chocolate chips, creamy ice cream and always filled to the BRIM! I did run into a huge air pocket on the side so I didnt get ALL of the container filled, but my body is probably thankful for that. The lid can sometimes be hard to put back on. But other than those functional pieces, the flavor is amazing and this is always a solid GO-TO always!"
16_bj,2018-06-05,1,Buy it only if you are up for a cookie dough hunt,I have purchased the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough multiple times so don't even try to tell me it's due to a particular ''manufacturing problem''. There is barely any cookie dough in the 500 mL pint. It is a total waste of my money.
16_bj,2020-07-25,4,,"Id give this flavor 3.5 stars if I could. Ben & Jerrys is usually awesome for me, a 4/5 stars typically (and Im a very tough ice cream critic) but this one just wasnt one of their better flavors. Now, this may be my fault because it is a rather stereotypical simple flavor, and I usually only get it at ice cream shops because their cookie dough and ice cream just taste better for some reason. So Im comparing this to my top favorite fresh cookie dough ice cream at ice cream shops, and to ben & Jerrys other more exciting flavors. If youre struggling to choose which brand of cookie dough ice cream you want at the store, just for the ben & Jerrys, its for sure one of the best brands for that flavor."
16_bj,2017-07-06,1,So disappointing!,"I was so disappointed by the chocolate chip cookie dough. There was hardly any cookie dough, the texture was gross and the ice cream was solid as a rock which made it very difficult to scoop and eat. I won't be buying that again, especially at that price!"
16_bj,2020-09-04,1,Really yummy but lacking cookie dough,"I really enjoy this flavour of B&J but lately it's definitely been lacking cookie dough. I am essentially paying for expensive vanilla ice cream; had anyone been searching for B&J's plain vanilla ice cream but had no luck, they could just pick up a pint of B&J's cookie dough and get exactly what they wanted. As a student I'm struggling to justify continuing to purchase this ice cream regularly as it's inconsistent with the distribution of cookie dough. I hope to receive some form of compensation and I hope to see Ben and Jerry take more action in bettering and improving this product."
16_bj,2020-03-24,5,My Obsession,"Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough is my most favorite one of all. It has the perfect balance of vanilla ice cream,chocolate chip pieces,and chunks of choc chip cookie dough. I personally eat a pint a night, and I wouldn't know how to act if I didn't have any. It is definitely my new,but not so new,OBSESSION!"
16_bj,2020-07-29,5,,I love this ice cream it is so delicious and wants to just melt her mouth this ice cream is not too expensive its really good you should get my ice cream over at Walmart I have not at Sams Club they have good deals in it especially in my shrooms are you guys going to go check it out
16_bj,2017-05-25,5,I promise you..you'll love it dough XDXD,Best ice cream like seriouslyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
16_bj,2019-07-01,2,Awful dough!!,The chocolate chip cookie dough was so hard and chalky! It wasn’t soft or fresh?? Not sure if this was a manufacture or transit problem. Extremely disappointed this was my first experience because my friends have always recommended this flavor to me
16_bj,2020-07-26,5,,"My alllll time favorite flavor! It is a perfect blend on chocolate chip, cookie dough and ice cream! This product is affordable but a liiiiitle on the high side when in comes to calories ESPECIALLY if you eat the whole pint like i do"
16_bj,2017-06-30,5,Possibly better than the real thing,"Ben and Jerry's never disappoints. I have had the chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream in both NYC and Burlington, Vermont, and both were nothing short of amazing. Maybe I was lucky, but the cookie dough portions were generous and the vanilla ice cream added some nice contrast. :)"
16_bj,2019-07-22,2,Bland,"This was the most expensive Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough ice cream I've purchased, but also the least flavorful. Mostly just the ice cream- very few cookie dough bites or chocolate chunks. Left me disappointed."
16_bj,2017-11-05,4,Could be improved.,"The cookie dough chunks in this, are very rare, or actually really inconsistent. I wish there were more chunks of cookie dough. Overall, this is by far the best tasting cookie dough ice cream. The cookie dough is good, it's just that sometimes I have 10 cookie dough chunks and once I've had 2 pieces. I just wish there were more globs."
16_bj,2017-12-28,3,Expected Better,"The vanilla ice cream is rich, creamy and has a strong vanilla the taste. I cant complain about the quantity of cookie dough because half the container was cookie dough. Unfortunately, the cookie dough was dry, crumbly and crunchy. I expected the cookie dough to be chewy and fresh, maybe I just got a bad batch."
16_bj,2020-05-10,4,,"I love the cookie dough! It tastes so good. This is probably one of my least favorite Ben and Jerrys flavors though, as I find the icecream to be pretty bland."
16_bj,2019-08-06,1,Dough was to dry and didnt taste as usual,"Today we bought a new Ben&Jerrys Cookie dough ice cream and we've been total dissapointed. The dough was dry, too hard and didnt taste as usual."
16_bj,2017-11-16,3,Nothing Memorable,"Ben and Jerry's made this flavor first, so they're well known for it. It's a not horrible flavor, it's kind of just there. My biggest complaint with this is that there isn't enough cookie dough, and I don't think it's because of some mistake in the manufacturing process. It kind of tastes like vanilla ice cream with the occasional chunk of dough. You could seriously improve this flavor if you increased the amount of cookie dough you put into these pints."
16_bj,2018-04-03,2,Delicious Vanilla Ice cream But not enough cookie,Good vanilla ice cream but not enough cookie dough
16_bj,2017-11-08,1,Where's the dough???,"This purchase left me very disappointed. It was as if I purchase a pint of vanilla ice cream. I didn't come across any cookie dough until after I was halfway through the container. At this point, I didn't eat any more ice cream but wasted the rest of the ice cream searching for the cookie dough. I doubt I will make this purchase again."
16_bj,2017-07-14,1,where's the gobs?!,"I like many others who wrote reviews am very upset about the lack of cookie dough in this cookie dough ice cream. My pint of ice cream had 4 pieces of cookie dough max. I expected better from Ben and Jerry's. I could have paid less for a different brand and got way more. But I thought they were the best-of the best, I was wrong."
16_bj,2017-07-15,2,Allergen not listed.,"I was super excited to try Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough since it has always been my favorite. I thought Ben and Jerry's would have been excellent but I was wrong. Unfortunately, all I could taste was coconut. I looked on the ingredient list and it states coconut oil is in the product but didn't list it as an allergen on the label. I am allergic to all coconut (yes even the oil) and tree nuts and was extremely disappointed as I had to throw the rest away. No more Ben and Jerry's for me."
16_bj,2017-06-07,3,Needs more dough,"It seems like the biggest complaint for this product is too little dough, which I agree with (no, it's not a manufacturing issue, in my case). But I also think that is the issue with ALL cookie dough ice cream. Just look up ""what ice cream has the most cookie dough"" and while you'll find that Ben and Jerry's does, but it still might not be enough. Clearly there is a consumer demand for a truly loaded cookie dough ice cream. I hope Ben and Jerry's will indulge us. Unfortunately, this product isn't it."
16_bj,2017-05-20,1,WHERE IS THE COOKIE DOUGH,I juat bought one of these for the first time..I took the first bite and no cookie dough..took another bite and then another still no cookie dough. So I turned it around and took a bite from the other side still nothing. there was not one price of cookie dough in the whole thing so I paid for Something I did not get and I'm very upset about it I have are Ben and jerseys my whole life and have never been disapointed until now
16_bj,2018-12-19,1,Would be excellent if there was cookie dough,"The first time I bought a pint of this I was over the moon with the ratio to cookie dough to ice cream to Chico chips, but as I kept purchasing I noticed there was less and less cookie dough/chocolate chips and more ice cream. This is disappointing and it’s kind of a waste of money to buy 6 dollar ice cream when you aren’t getting what you’re buying."
16_bj,2019-07-03,5,Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Is BAE,Can we start by saying that Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough is bae?!? I started purchasing this flavor over a year ago & I’ve been addicted every since! The ONE thing I would change is having more cookie dough in each pint. I often feel like I have to buy more before finishing fully because I run out of cookie dough lol! I did try the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core & plan to leave my honest opinion under its own picture!
16_bj,2017-06-06,5,The Best,The Classic Ben and Jerry's. This is the best of all flavors and shall forever be.
16_bj,2017-05-10,5,Amazing,Everyone knows Ben & Jerry's is the best. Let's get real here.
16_bj,2020-06-01,5,,If you havent tried Ben & Jerrys I honestly dont know what youre doing I live in Vermont and that was where Ben and Jerrys was invented and honestly I think theyre awesome because of the variety they give you and all the different kinds they have their ice cream cones taste amazing in their ice cream even though there are funky flavors they all suck each other very well and then come up with the best names for them you cant go wrong with any of their flavors[product:ben-&-jerrys-chocolate-chip-cookie-dough-ice-cream]
16_bj,2020-07-25,4,,This ice cream is also really good! The only issue I have is that there is so much variance in the amount of cookie dough bites that sometimes there are not enough and others there are WAY too many to be a nice balance. The cookie dough pieces and vanilla ice cream are a classic pair and this ice cream is very good!
16_bj,2017-10-17,5,"Awesome, safe for pregnancy?","I loooove this, flavor I buy it all the time. I recently found out a friend of mine is pregnant and she stopped eating it. I’m just curious if the eggs in the dough are raw? Or is it safe for pregnant women to eat? If so I could let her know and she can eat as much as her heart desires. Thanks!"
16_bj,2018-01-19,2,Very disappointed,"I’ve been buying Ben and Jerry ice cream off and on for years. I’m referring to the last year I have been purchasing your cookie dough ice cream. Although it never contained the amount of cookie dough consumers were led to believe it did in the advertised pictures or descriptions it still contained more and better tasting cookie dough than other brands I have tried. I was pleased a lot times in the beginning, but I still would have liked to see more cookie dough. Also with most of the cookie dough being toward the top and very little or almost none further down was another disappointing factor. I also find consistency to be all over the place."
16_bj,2020-07-26,4,,"I really love how Ben and Jerry's always have these crazy new flavors, but this one is my all-time favorite. While the ice cream is all sweet, I like the perfect balance of salt in the cookie dough to even out the taste. Even though the price of the pint is not always right, it was good for at least three servings because I tend to only eat two scoops at a time. If you are planning for a big party, this might not be enough for obvious reasons. However, for a kick on an occasional sweet tooth, it is perfect!"
16_bj,2018-07-10,5,Life Changing,"Cookie dough is my all time favorite flavor no matter what brand, so I have to thank yall for inventing this. That being said, this is hands down the BEST out of them all! Nothing comes close to this, you can tell the cookie dough could make actual cookies."
16_bj,2018-07-03,5,,"I don’t always go for ice cream, but when I do this is my favourite. I actually just made a cake for my son with this. Oreo cookie base, Ben and Jerry’s cookies and creak ice cream and drizzle chocolate sauce and let it set in the freezer. Amazing"
16_bj,2017-11-16,5,this is my favorite flavor,i love that flavor! I am 10 years old i just got done eating some chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream 15 minutes ago. I visited the factory in Vermont in August. The chocolate chip cookie dough i had 15 minutes ago was from Ben and Jerrys
16_bj,2018-11-11,5,,Since I was little Ben & Jerry’s cookie dough ice cream has been one of my favorites. It is a little more expensive than some other brands but the flavor is worth it. I will buy more and definitely recommend trying it.
16_bj,2018-11-11,5,,I could eat this for breakfast lunch and dinner haha I absolutely love this ice cream. It’s the best hands down. It’s a little pricey but you get what you pay for. This is an all time fav at girls night for sure.
16_bj,2018-10-29,5,Mine always has dough,"Not sure what luck everyone else is having but mine always has plenty of dough. It's really good dough! And the icecream doesn't taste plain, it's very vanilla flavored, almost like a vanilla bean icecream."
16_bj,2018-08-02,5,,I love this ice cream. Especially since Blue Bell has its issue with the recalls in the past. Every since I’ve been eating this brand and I just say I’m not disappointed at all. Overall I’m satisfied with!
16_bj,2018-11-10,5,,Omg my favourite ice cream! Everything about this ice cream is amazing! Ice cream is my fave and I’m very picky but this is delicious. The only thing I would say is that my local supermarkets sell for £5!
16_bj,2018-11-11,4,,Does it really get any better than ben and Jerry's ice cream? I mean c'mon?! Always a staple for our family on movie night. So many different flavors to choose from so everyone gets their own.
16_bj,2017-09-24,1,"All Vanilla, Nothing Else","So sad that I decided to break my no ice cream streak with this particular flavor. There was barely any cookie dough, and even less chocolate chips. Waste of the $8 a pint costs in NYC."
16_bj,2017-08-06,1,It was ok vanilla ice cream,"Got a pint for cheat day, and there was not a single cookie dough pellet in the entire pint. It was plain vanilla ice cream with about 15 chocolate chips in the whole thing."
16_bj,2018-10-05,5,,Cookie dough really taste like cookie dough. It’s really hard to find an ice cream that has that real dough taste. You also get dough or chocolate chips in every bite.
16_bj,2018-09-15,5,,An absolute favourite ! Plus I love the half baked flavour. The mix of flavours this brand offers differentiates itself from other brands and is totally worth it!
16_bj,2018-08-02,5,,"Nice big chunks of cookie dough, great vanilla ice cream. I mean can you really go wrong with Ben and Jerry's?"
16_bj,2018-09-11,5,,Dangerous to have in my house I’ll eat it all. It is the only comfort food that my life needs. Get you some
16_bj,2017-06-02,1,No dough!,Not a single piece of cookie dough! Very frustrating! Especially at the price of Ben & Jerry's!
16_bj,2018-11-09,5,,"Guilty pleasure! Perfect for the sweet tooth, lots of cookie dough pieces and chocolate chips."
16_bj,2017-09-06,1,Didn't like it,"Tasted like Just really sugary Vanilla Ice Cream, I couldn't taste the cookie dough gobs."
16_bj,2020-04-28,1,Inconsistent flavor,"Decided to indulge in a Ben & Jerry’s cookie dough pint and it was a disappointing splurge! This is the second time now having this experience. The ice cream was very chalky and had a weird after taste. Maybe an inconsistent batch? No cookie dough chunks a few chocolate bits, was very dry and brittle. The base vanilla ice cream had a chalky taste to it and as you tried to scoop it out of the pint was flaky. No ice crystals but left a powdery film on your palate."
16_bj,2017-04-26,1,No Cookie Dough,"They tasted ok I guess, but there wasn't one piece of cookie dough in the entire box I bought; that's the reason for my review. Quality was fine but without cookie dough they aren't what I bought."
16_bj,2020-05-31,4,,I'm really not a sweets fan and by association an 8ce cream fan but who doesn't love Ben & Jerry's Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Ice Cream? It's just good! Smooth and creamy with bite sized chunks of the raw cookie dough that you all know we grew up stealing and eating if our moms were baking cookies. Mine didn't but I learned how to as a kid so that's what I did. As a whole it's a great brand with unique flavors. Something for everyone.
16_bj,2018-05-04,1,Disappointed..........,"Like many of the other reviewers, I can't find much cookie dough. I usually spend the extra cash for Ben and Jerry's, but I am so disappointed in this flavor. I guess I will go back to buying a gallon of another brand for the same price. I had such high hopes when I bought this....."
16_bj,2020-07-27,4,,"This was delicious. They have enough chunks of cookie dough so that there was at least one little cookie dough bite in each spoon full. Theres also a great balance of the cookie dough, chocolate chips, and ice cream so that youre able to actually taste all the ingredients. Only downfall for me is the taste of the ice cream base, it is kind of bland and think it could have more of a vanilla or cookie dough flavor."
16_bj,2020-07-22,5,,For starters this is my go to chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream brand because I feel as if they put the most cookie dough bites in their ice cream. I know they tend to be on the pricier side but I dont mind paying a little more considering the companies values. I encourage anyone to look into Ben & Jerrys and learn more about how they are passing it forward to their employees and the world.

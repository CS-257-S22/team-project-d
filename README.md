For grader for command line interface assignment:
ice_cream.py contains the main code to run and test.py is our test suite

For the functions within ice_cream.py: 

(1) -b [brand name]: Use this command to search for ice creams from a specific
                brand. We have ice creams across four different brands: Ben and Jerry's (bj),
                Haagen-Dazs (hd), Talenti, and Breyers. [brand name] should be an alias of
                either of these four brands.
                                   (ex) python3 ice_cream.py -b bj")
(2) -r [rating]: Use this command to search for ice cream flavors that have a
               specified rating or higher. [rating] should be a float/integer between 0 and 5
               inclusive.
                                    (ex) python3 ice_cream.py -r 4.9")
(3) -s [top x]: Use this command to return a sorted list of x ice creams with \
               the highest reviews. We have 241 ice creams in total, and thus [top x] \
               needs to be an integer between 0 and 241 inclusive. \
                                    (ex) python3 ice_cream.py -s 50")

Repo for Team D in CS 257. 

For grader for front end assignment:
All the necessary files are in the "Fron End" folder. 

1) ice_cream.py is our production code, and ice_cream_test.py is our test suite for that. They need 
the "Data" folder in the directory that is one-level lower as it is now, so the easiest is to pull 
both the "Front End" and "Data" folders.
2) app.py is our app, and app_test.py is our test suite for that. They need the "templates" folder, 
the "static" folder, and ice_cream.py to be in the same directory as they are. Also, they need the "Data"
folder in the directory that is one-level lower as it is now, so the easiest way is to pull "Front End"
and "Data" together and run. 

For grader for revised flask app assignment:
All the necessary files are in the "Code" folder. ice_cream.py contains the main code to run and 
ice_cream_test.py is our test suite. flask_app.py contains our flask app, 
flask_app_test.py contains a test suite for flask_app.py, and the templates folder contains html files. ice_cream.py, flask_app.py, flask_app_test.py and templates need to stay in the same directory to be run.

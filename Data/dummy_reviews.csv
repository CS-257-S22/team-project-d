bj,0_bj,Ilovebennjerry,2017-04-15,3,Not enough brownies!,10.0,3.0,"Super good, don't get me wrong. But I came for the caramel and brownies, not the sweet cream. The packaging made it seem like brownies were packed and bountiful *crying frowny emoji* I'd say the taste of this was amazing, but the ratio of brownie to sweet cream was disappointing. Liked it regardless but probably won't buy again simply because it didn't live up to its promising package. I'll find another one that has a better ratio and wayyy more yummy chewy brownies.
Overall, good flavor, texture, idea, and brownies. Not so great caramel/sweet cream/ brownie RATIO. Just add more brownies. Please.",,,,
bj,0_bj,Sweettooth909,2020-01-05,5,I’m OBSESSED with this pint!,3.0,0.0,"I decided to try it out although I’m not a huge caramel fan, and the first buy was ok, didn’t like the caramel too much and for some reason that specific pint barely had any brownies! Like there were some on top but from the middle to the bottom? Zilch. Nada. Nothing! It was disappointing. But for some reason, I bought it again and I really do believe it was just that point bcuz the second one was glorious!! I had a big brownie chunk in EVERY bite. Plus the caramel didn’t bother me as much and I took a liking to it. Conclusion: I’m on my fifth pint, of the week and I’m going back to get my daily pint cus I’m kinda sick and need some happiness.",,,,
bj,1_bj,ChrisColby,2020-03-01,5,"So simple, yet so effective.",11.0,0.0,"Ben and Jerry's took the peanut butter/chocolate flavor and knocked it out the park yet again. The peanut butter ice cream is great as always, but combined with the pretzel swirls, the flavor is heightened to an amazing degree. A nice little crunch to the pretzels as well for texture. The brownies aren't quite as good as in other flavors but definitely plentiful and still tasty. Put em all together and you get a salty/sweet peanut butter and chocolate combination that just works. A great flavor.",,,,
bj,1_bj,wormmoons,2020-03-31,5,THIS IS THE BEST ICE CREAM IVE EVER HAD,12.0,1.0,"The actual peanut butter ice cream is amazing, the brownie chunks taste like they were just cooked. The pretzel bits are the most amazing thing I have eaten, they are not too salty. They are not crunchy or too soft, evert time I get a bite with the pretzel in it I have to just stop and savor it. So far I have only found these at Target I have shared about eight pints in a couple weeks with my husband. Honestly it's the best ice cream I've ever had. Hard, soft, homemade, vegan or non, it's the best.",,,,
hd,0_hd,wyatt,2017-04-10,5,one of the best ice creams on the planet.,27.0,0.0,"if this flavor is ever retired, i swear -- my lifespan might shorten by a few years. it features a perfect, not-overly-sweet, creamy base that captures the essence of cocoa butter. juxtapose that base with the just-tart-enough raspberry coulis ribbon and the bittersweet fudge truffles, and guess what -- a trifecta! i buy pints of this flavor like water; it keeps me alive. when i taste other ice creams, i often use this flavor as the benchmark to which i compare them: how does that flavor compare to WCRT? the balance in this flavor profile and/or texture variation is rarely, if ever, matched.",5.0,5.0,5.0,
hd,0_hd,Savvisyd,2019-03-05,5,Literally the best of the best,10.0,0.0,I am an ice cream addict and this flavour has blown everything out of the water. No other ice cream of any brand or flavour holds a candle to it. It has made my previous favourites taste mediocre and lack lustre. My partner and I are absolutely bonkers about it and would love to have an easier time finding it in grocery stores or convenience stores. A couple months ago it was all over and now it has become really challenging to find it and we are devastated. We just had to share our last tub instead of having one each!,5.0,5.0,5.0,

hd,5_hd,MC Hammer,2020-08-12,4,"Buy the Caramel, not the Vanilla Bar",3.0,0.0,"There's quite a difference between the caramel and vanilla bars, probably because the caramel makes the texture creamier, while the vanilla ice cream is icy and crystalline. Further, the chocolate dip combines better with the caramel for a better overall flavor as well. This is reflected in the caramel flavor being out of stock more. Don't buy the vanilla.",4.0,4.0,5.0,"Perfectly Balanced Flavor,Creamy Texture"
talenti,0_talenti,amys,2018-06-22,5,Mango Madness,12.0,0.0,"Y’all! I’m sick as a dog!!! For reals! Temp of over 101. Begged my mom to get me some talenti because it’s my new favorite again. Anyways I told her to get something non-dairy for my throat so it wouldn’t get all yucky. She brings me this flavor.
O.M.G. THIS IS SO GOOD!!!!!
Ok, I have a cold so everything tastes bland so this shouldn’t be all that great right? No. This tastes like the actual mango, but like better than the actual mango!!!
Seriously! Every flavor I try is my new favorite!! I 100% recommend this and all the other flavors! Talenti is the best. Oh! And there’s always a treat at the end. You can reuse the container. These guys are the best!!",,,,
talenti,0_talenti,Hesskr,2017-10-29,5,Mangos Mashed Up,21.0,0.0,"This is seriously like eating fresh mangoes smashed up and put into a container. Many other surveys on the market remind me to much of ice cream and have a creaminess to them. Some people enjoy this, however I prefer a sorbet to taste just like fresh fruit. The ingredients in this could not be more direct. Mangoes, sugar, water, dextrose And lemon juice. At first I did not think I would like the tartness from the lemon juice. However it gives just a bit of lemon flavor, Which almost accentuates the mangoes. This is by far our favorite!",,,,

The layers create the perfect combination of YUM!!!! The textures all come together to make this gelato such an indulgent treat!!! It reminds me of a frozen version of Banana Foster! So good!",,,,
talenti,1_talenti,DesiCakes,2020-05-14,4,Subtle banana flavor,5.0,0.0,"Most Banana products have a artificial flavor, which isn't the best tasting. However this Gelato doesn't have that gross artificial taste. It was really good on it's own but even more so with the caramel and shortbread. I honestly wish there was more caramel because it really doesn't have a lot and you can barely taste it, had to add my own. But overall if you like Banana, you will like this! I recommend giving it a shot.",,,,
breyers,0_breyers,LABEL READER,2020-04-17,2,EVER INCREASING INGEDIENTS LIST.,81.0,3.0,"Not the long ago Breyers set itself apart from other brands by using ONLY MILK, CREAM, SUGAR, and VANILLA in it's Vanilla ice cream. They went so far as to have TV commercials with children reading the ver very simple label. Now they show similar comercials stating the Breyers is made WITH those ingredients but no longer ONLY WITH. Read the label for yourself. The ice cream is still good but the longer ingrediants list ant the missing word ""ONLY"" hasn't gone unnoticed despite the attempt to gloss over the corporate decision to move away from the one distinctive characteristic that set the Breyers brand apart from the others.",,,,
breyers,0_breyers,AK in WA,2020-06-09,1,This is NO LONGER the Breyers We Used to Know,94.0,2.0,"I must agree with many one-star ratings here. The main beef is the huge change in your formula/ingredients. It's always been Breyers. When I first moved to the west coast, there was no Breyers, so I did not eat ice cream for several years. Then it's here ... in the past several years I've noticed: a) it no longer stays frozen long enough to eat it; b) when it melts, it forms into a scary gummy mess. Breyers used to melt and turn back into cream and milk basically. Why on earth would you decide to take a once delicious natural treat and load it up with a boatload of nasty chemicals that have RUINED YOUR PRODUCT?",,,,
